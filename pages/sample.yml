    - content: The adventures of Mark Twain is a misnomer basically of the book titled adventures of Huckleberry Finn and the book presents the story of a young boy, but in fact it kinda deals with his thought processes and things happen in the story in such a way that it's a massive puzzle and it is still fitting in the right pieces. It's a story more about the author's thoughts in my perspective than the story of the main character, the boy.
    - content: This article will basically present my rough thouhts on these themes

            quote: His friends basically hunted wild animals using rifles as children and he ate the meat, there is no direct mention of him hunting or learning to hunt or even about knowing how to shoot. Fincon does mention that he knew a great deal about guns and even how to make gun powder. Fincon mentions multiple instances where Mark made sacs of gunpowder
