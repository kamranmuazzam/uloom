= Fracture
== Supracondylar Fracture

=== Presentation
- Age group is usually 5-8 years old, the ossification center in the lower end of humerus fuse at 10 years, and appear at around 5 years, in this period, the bone is elastic in nature and fracture might occur if fall on outstretched hand.
- FOOHC
*Look* - Swollen Elbow with S Shaped deformity
*Feel* - Tenderness, Neurovascular Status
*Move* - Restricted movement and very tense & painful movement
=== Treatment
- If distal neurovasculature is intact, closed reduction and internal fixation by percutaneous KOM
- If distal neurovasculature is comprimised, closed reduction is contraindiaction. In this case open reduction and internal fixation by percutaneous KOM. Observation for Compartment Sydrome in this case.

== Fracture Neck of Femur
=== Presentation
Radiology: X-Ray femur, AP view and lateral view of Pelvis
- Disruption of Shanton's line
- Tip of the greater trochanter of both limbs are not in same line.
- Trabecular line is nt well defined in affected side.
- Neck shaft angle is obliterated in affected side.

=== Complications
*Local*
- Early
 - Shorterning
 - Nerve Injury
- Late
 - Avascular Necrosis of Head of Femur
 - Nonunion and malunion
 - Osteoarthritis of neck of femur
*General*
Due to Prolong Immobilization causing
- Deep vein thrombosis
- Pulmonary embolism
- Hypostatic pneumonia
- Progressive bed sore
- Nephrolithiasis
- Decalcification

=== Treatment
*If undisplaced*
- At first internal fixation by hip screw under C-arm control
- If fails then hip prosthesis is given
*If displaced*
- Replacement by prosthesis (replacement hemiarthroplasty of femoral component with unipolar or bipolar prosthesis)

*Counselling for Hip Replacement*


= Chronic Osteomyelitis
== Radiological Findings
Radio-opaque lesion in the bone surrounded by radioluscent area
== Treatment
- Sequestectomy and Saucerization#footnote[Saucerization is increasing the surface area of the lesion.]
- Filling the cavity by bone graft or bone cement
- Antibiotics according to C/S
- Splintage to immobilize the affected part and healing occurs
== Sequestrum
Sequestrum is a piece of dead bone within a living bone surrounded by granulation tissue caused by pyogenic organism.

*Formation*
  
- Infection at metaphysial endosteum
- Percolate through Haversian system to periosteum
- Subperiosteal abscess formation
- Lifting the periosteum
- Ishcemia and suppurative necrosis of bone
- Segmental bone necrosis
- Formation of piece of dead bone
- Sequestrum

== Involucrum

= Bone Tumor
== Metastatic Bone Tumor
Common sources of metastatic bone tumor
- Breast(73%)
- Lung(32%)
- Prostate
- Kidney(24%)
- Thyroid
- Rectum(13%)
- Stomach(11%)

Common Sites of Metastatic Bone Tumor
- Vertebrae
- Ribs
- Pelvic Bone
- Sternum
- Skull
- Upper end of femur
- Upper end of humerus

Investigation suggested to evaluate metastatic bone tumor
