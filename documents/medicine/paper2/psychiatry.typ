== Delusion, Ilusion and Hallucination
=== Delusion
A delusion is a fixed false belief based on an incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly held despite what almost everyone else believes and despite incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.
==== Example/ Classification
*Persecutory Delusion*: The belief that one is being harassed, cheated, or persecuted. Example: Believing the police are constantly following them for no reason.

*Grandiose Delusion*: An exaggerated sense of self-importance, power, knowledge, or identity. Example: Believing they are a king or have a special mission to save the world.

*Delusion of Reference*: The belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. Example: Believing that a news report is a coded message specifically for them.

*Erotomanic Delusion*: The belief that another person, often someone of a higher social status, is in love with them.

*Nihilistic Delusion*: The belief that the self, a part of the self, or the world is non-existent. Example: Believing their internal organs have rotted away.

*Somatic Delusion*: A false belief involving the functioning of one's body. Example: Believing one has a terrible disease despite all medical tests being negative.

*Delusion of Guilt or Sin*: A false feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity. Example: Believing they are responsible for a natural disaster.

*Delusion of Jealousy (Othello Syndrome)*: A false belief that one's spouse or partner is unfaithful, without any real proof.

*Delusions of Control, Influence, or Passivity*: The belief that one's thoughts, feelings, or actions are being controlled by an external force.

*Thought Insertion*: Believing that thoughts are being put into their mind.

*Thought Withdrawal*: Believing that thoughts have been taken out of their mind.

*Thought Broadcasting*: Believing that their thoughts are being broadcasted to others.

])

==== Causes of Delusion:

The exact cause is unknown, but it is likely multifactorial:

*Biological Factors*:

- *Genetics*: A family history of psychotic disorders increases the risk.
- *Neurochemical Imbalance*: Dysregulation of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine.

*Psychological Factors*:
- *Stress and Trauma*: Severe stress or traumatic events can trigger delusions.
- *Personality*: Individuals with pre-existing paranoid, schizoid, or schizotypal personality traits may be more vulnerable.

*Environmental Factors*:
- *Social Isolation*: Lack of social contact can contribute to the development of delusional ideas.
- *Substance Abuse*: Use of certain drugs (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) can induce psychosis.

=== Illusion
A misinterpretation or misperception of a real external stimulus.
=== Hallucination
A hallucination is a false perception in the absence of an actual external stimulus.
==== Example
- *Auditory*: Hearing a voice commenting on one's actions when no one is present.
- *Visual*: Seeing a person standing in the corner of a room when no one is present.
- *Tactile*: Feeling insects crawling on or under one's skin.
== Anxiety Disorders
Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come, disproportionate to the actual danger. Anxiety Neurosis is an older term for anxiety disorders.

=== Classification of Anxiety Disorders (DSM-5):

+ *Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)*: Excessive worry about various things.
+ *Panic Disorder*: Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks.
+ *Agoraphobia*: Fear of situations where escape might be difficult.
+ *Specific Phobia*: Intense fear of a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, spiders).
+ *Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)*: Fear of social situations and scrutiny.
+ *Separation Anxiety Disorder*
+ *Selective Mutism*

=== Clinical Features

==== Psychological Symptoms

- Apprehension, worry, and a sense of impending doom.
- Irritability and impatience.
- Poor concentration and mind going blank.
- Restlessness and feeling "on edge."
- Hypervigilance.
==== Somatic (Physical) Symptoms
- *Cardiovascular*: Palpitations, tachycardia, chest pain.
- *Respiratory*: Shortness of breath, hyperventilation, choking sensation.
- *Gastrointestinal*: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, "butterflies in the stomach."
- *Neurological*: Dizziness, lightheadedness, trembling, tingling (paresthesia).
- *Musculoskeletal*: Muscle aches and tension.
- *Autonomic*: Sweating, dry mouth, flushing.

=== Management of Anxiety Disorders
==== General & Supportive Measures

- *Reassurance & Psychoeducation*: Explain the nature of the illness to the patient and family to reduce stigma and improve adherence.

- *Lifestyle Modification*: Advise on stress management techniques, regular physical exercise, adequate sleep hygiene, and avoiding caffeine and other stimulants.

==== Psychological Treatment (Psychotherapy)

- *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)*: This is the first-line psychological treatment. It helps patients identify, challenge, and reframe their anxious thoughts (cognitive restructuring) and modify their avoidance behaviors.

- *Relaxation Techniques*: Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness.

==== Pharmacological Treatment (Pharmacotherapy)

- *First-line*: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like Sertraline, Escitalopram, or Paroxetine. They are started at a low dose and gradually increased. Full effect takes 4-6 weeks.

- *Second-line*: Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) like Venlafaxine or Duloxetine.

- *Short-term/Adjunctive*: Benzodiazepines (e.g., Clonazepam, Lorazepam) can be used for rapid relief of severe symptoms for a short duration (2-4 weeks) due to the high risk of dependence.

,caption:[Antipsychotic Drugs, Classification, Names and Side Effects])

- *Other options*: Buspirone (non-sedating anxiolytic), Pregabalin.

==== Extrapyramidal Side Effects of Antipsychotic Drugs
EPS are drug-induced movement disorders.

+ *Acute Dystonia*: Sudden, sustained muscle contractions (e.g., torticollis, oculogyric crisis).

+ *Akathisia*: Subjective feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling urge to move.

+ *Parkinsonism*: Bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor.

+ *Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)*: Involuntary, repetitive body movements (e.g., lip-smacking, grimacing). Often occurs late and can be irreversible.

=== Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)
==== Clinical Features:

*Physical (Neurological) Symptoms*

- *Motor*: Weakness or paralysis, abnormal movements (tremor, dystonia), abnormal limb posturing.

- *Sensory*: Altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision (blindness), or hearing (deafness).

- *Seizures*: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ("pseudoseizures").

*Psychological Features*:

Temporal association with a stressful event or conflict.

- *La belle indiff√©rence*: A naive, unconcerned attitude towards what appears to be a major impairment.

- *Secondary gain*: The patient derives an advantage from the symptoms (e.g., avoiding responsibility).

==== Management:

*Reassurance & Education*: Explain that the symptoms are real but not due to a neurological disease. Avoid confrontation.

*First-line Treatment*: Physiotherapy for motor symptoms and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to address underlying psychological stressors.

*Pharmacotherapy*: No specific medication. Treat co-morbid anxiety or depression if present.

*Multidisciplinary Approach*: Involve neurologists, psychiatrists, and physiotherapists.

=== Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions.

==== Obsessions
Recurrent, persistent, and intrusive thoughts, urges, or images that cause significant anxiety or distress. The person tries to ignore or suppress them. (e.g., fear of contamination, doubts about having locked the door).

==== Compulsions
Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules. They are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety. (e.g., repetitive hand washing, checking, counting).

==== Management of OCD (e.g., a female who washes her hands 50 times/day)

+ *Psychoeducation*: Explain the "vicious cycle" of OCD to the patient.

+ *Psychotherapy (First-line)*: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).

 - *Exposure*: Gradually expose the patient to the feared object or situation (e.g., touching a "dirty" object).

 - *Response Prevention*: The patient is prevented from performing the compulsive ritual (e.g., not allowed to wash hands). This helps them learn that the anxiety subsides on its own.

+ *Pharmacotherapy (First-line)*: SSRIs (e.g., Fluoxetine, Sertraline) at higher doses than those used for depression.

+ *Combination*: The best outcome is often achieved with a combination of CBT (ERP) and SSRIs.
