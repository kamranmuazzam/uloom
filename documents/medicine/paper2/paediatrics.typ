== Growth and Development
=== Growth
Growth refers to physical maturation and signifies an increase in size of the body parts and various organs. It occurs as a result of the body parts and various organs. It occurs as a result of tissue hyperplasia, hypertrophy and differentiation.
=== Development
Development refers to acquisition and maturation of skills, behaviour and values on the part of the growing child. It mostly depends on the maturation of nervous system.

== IYCF
Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) recommendations ensure optimal growth, development, immunity, and long-term health.  

=== Breast Feeding
*Definition*: Breastfeeding is the *gold standard* for infant nutrition, providing immunological, nutritional, psychological, and maternal health benefits.  

==== Exclusive Breast Feeding
*Definition*: Feeding the infant *only breast milk* (including expressed milk, from mother or wet nurse) for the *first 6 months* of life. No additional food or drink, not even water, except oral rehydration solution, drops/syrups of vitamins, minerals, or medicines.  

*Benefits*
- Complete, easily digestible nutrition for 6 months  
- Passive immunity → fewer infections (esp. diarrhea, pneumonia, otitis media)  
- Reduces infant mortality and morbidity  
- Enhances psychomotor and emotional development  
- Prevents malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies  
- Long-term protection: ↓ risk of asthma, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease  
- Maternal benefits: ↓ postpartum hemorrhage, aids uterine involution, lactational amenorrhea (birth spacing), ↓ risk of breast & ovarian cancer, osteoporosis  
- Economical and always sterile  

#info_box([Proper Positioning], [
+ Infant's head & trunk in one line  
+ Baby facing the breast, abdomen-to-abdomen  
+ Baby's whole body supported (not just neck/shoulder)  
+ Mother relaxed, sitting comfortably  
]
)

#info_box([Proper Attachment],[
+ Infant's mouth wide open  
+ Chin pressing into the breast  
+ Lower lip everted outward  
+ More areola visible above than below  
+ Slow, deep suckling with audible swallowing  
]
)

=== Complementary Feeding
*Definition*: The *introduction of appropriate solid/semi-solid foods* in addition to continued breastfeeding, when breast milk alone is no longer sufficient, i.e. *after completion of 6 months*.  

*Schedule*:
- *Start at completed 6 months* with thick mashed food  
- 6-8 months → 2-3 meals/day + breastfeeds  
- 9-11 months → 3-4 meals/day + 1-2 nutritious snacks + breastfeeds  
- 12-24 months → 3-4 nutrient-dense meals + 1-2 snacks + continued breastfeeding  

*Properties of Good Food*:
- *Adequate*: Energy-dense & nutrient-rich  
- *Consistency*: Thick purée/semisolid initially → family food by 12 months  
- *Safe & Hygienic*: Fresh, properly cooked, stored carefully  
- *Dietary Diversity*: Include staples, pulses, vegetables, fruits, milk products, eggs, meat/fish (if culturally accepted)  
- *Responsive Feeding*: Caregiver should encourage and assist feeding in a supportive, non-coercive way  

== Neonatology

=== Perinatal Asphyxia
*Diagnosis*:
- Apgar < 7 at 5 minutes

3. If apneic / HR < 100 → PPV with bag-mask
4. If HR < 60 → Chest compressions (3:1 ratio) + ventilation
5. If still HR < 60 → Give adrenaline IV/ET, consider volume expansion
6. Post-resuscitation monitoring, NICU admission

*Complications*:

2. Treat/prevent hypothermia (keep warm, skin-to-skin care in infants)  
3. Treat/prevent dehydration (ReSoMal preferred, avoid standard ORS due to high sodium)  
4. Correct electrolyte imbalance (K+, Mg++ supplementation, restrict Na+)  
5. Treat infections (empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics regardless of septic signs)  
6. Correct micronutrient deficiencies (Vit A, zinc, folate, multivitamins; give iron only after child has stabilized and started gaining weight)  
7. Start cautious feeding (F-75 starter diet; avoid overfeeding to prevent refeeding syndrome)  
8. Catch-up growth (transition to F-100 or RUTF, encourage frequent energy/protein dense feeds)  
9. Provide sensory stimulation + emotional support (child-centered play, mother involvement)  
10. Prepare follow-up after discharge (link to community based rehabilitation, growth monitoring, nutritional counseling)

== Renal Diseases
=== Nephrotic Syndrome
==== Diagnosis
Patient complains of periorbital edema seen initially after waking up, which decreases during the day. After a few days, edema spreads and becomes generalized.

The patient also complains of reduced urine output (oliguria). The urine appears normal in color.

Other associated symptoms include anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and irritability.

There may be a history of recent skin infection or insect bite, but not of throat infection.

On examination: child may show generalized swelling, normal BP and temperature, rashes may be seen, and bedside urine examination reveals heavy proteinuria (albumin 3+/4+).

*Provisional Diagnosis*: Nephrotic Syndrome, most likely due to Minimal Change Disease.
==== Investigation
*To confirm the diagnosis*
- Urine R/E (proteinuria ≥3+)
- 24 hour urine protein (≥3.5 g/day)
- Serum albumin (low)
- Serum cholesterol and triglycerides (elevated)

*To rule out differentials*
- ASO titre
- Complement levels (C3, C4)
- Blood glucose / HbA1c
- Renal function tests (serum creatinine, BUN)
- Hepatitis B and C serology
- Renal biopsy (only if steroid resistant, atypical features or frequent relapses)

*To assess general status*
- CBC
- RFT, electrolytes

*Findings of investigations*
- Urine R/E: proteinuria, lipiduria; absence of RBC casts favors Nephrotic Syndrome over AGN
- Serum albumin decreased, serum cholesterol & triglycerides increased
- Hemoconcentration may lead to slightly raised Hb/Hct
- Raised ASO titre & low C3: suggestive of AGN
- Raised creatinine/BUN: may indicate other nephropathies, baseline renal function
- Elevated glucose/HbA1c: Diabetic Nephropathy
- HBsAg / Anti-HCV positive: viral associated nephropathy
==== Treatment
- Hospitalization often needed at first episode for parent education, especially recognition of complications and monitoring with urine dipstick.
- Prednisolone *60 mg/m²/day (max 60 mg)* for 4-6 weeks
- Then Prednisolone *40 mg/m² on alternate days* for another 4-6 weeks

#info_box([Tuberculosis must be ruled out before starting treatment],[
Before starting immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids, screen for tuberculosis using Mantoux / IGRA test and confirm negative result.
])

Investigations:
- Urine microscopy: pyuria, bacteriuria
- Urine culture: definitive for diagnosis
- CBC: leukocytosis
- High suspicion in infants < 2 years with unexplained fever

==== Treatment
- 1st-line oral antibiotic: Cephalexin or Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (7-10 days)

  - Vitamin D therapy (e.g. 2000 IU/day × 3 months OR stoss therapy 150,000-600,000 IU oral/IM single dose depending on age and severity)  
  - Calcium supplementation  
  - Sunlight exposure  
- *Underlying cause*: treat CKD, malabsorption, liver disease  
- *Genetic forms*: Calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues, oral phosphate supplements (for hypophosphatemic rickets)  
- *Prevention*:  
  - Supplement all exclusively breastfed infants with 400 IU/day vitamin D  
  - Adequate maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and lactation  

== Poisoning in Children

=== General Principles
*Management of Accidental Poisoning*:  
- Stabilize *Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC)* first  
- Identify toxin (history, container, odor, clinical features)  
- Prevent further absorption:  
  - Gastric lavage: only if within 1 hr and NOT contraindicated (contra: kerosene, corrosives, seizures, unconscious without airway protection)  
  - Activated charcoal: 1 g/kg if toxin adsorbs and presentation within 1-2 hrs  
  - Avoid emetics (syrup of ipecac obsolete)  
- Enhance elimination (selective: alkalinization, forced diuresis, dialysis - rarely required)  
- Give specific antidote when available  
- Supportive and symptomatic care (fluids, O2, seizure control, ventilation as required)  
- Prevent recurrence: parental counseling, safe storage of drugs, pesticides, kerosene  



=== Common Poisons

==== Organophosphorus (OPC) Poisoning
*Diagnosis* (Cholinergic features → "DUMBELS"):  
- *Muscarinic*: Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Bronchorrhea, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation, Sweating  
- *Nicotinic*: Fasciculations, weakness, paralysis  
- *CNS*: Anxiety, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression  

*Management*:  
- ABCs - often ventilatory support needed due to muscle weakness/paralysis  
- Decontamination (remove contaminated clothes, thorough skin wash)  
- *Atropine*:  
  - IV 0.02-0.05 mg/kg bolus, repeat every 5-10 min  
  - End point = Atropinization → drying of bronchial secretions, clear chest, HR >80-100/min, pupils mid-dilated  
- *Oximes (Pralidoxime chloride)*: 25-50 mg/kg IV over 30 min, repeat every 6-12 hr; effective if given early (before aging of enzyme)  
- *Seizures*: treat with benzodiazepines  



==== Kerosene Poisoning
- Very common (children ingesting from bottles used for storage)  
- *Main risk*: Aspiration pneumonitis (due to vomiting/induced emesis)  
- *Clinical features*: Cough, choking, tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis; CNS depression in severe poisoning  
- *Management*:  
  - NO gastric lavage / NO emesis induction  
  - Supportive: secure airway, give supplemental O2, IV fluids if required  
  - Bronchodilators if bronchospasm present  
  - Antibiotics only if secondary bacterial pneumonia is proven  
  - Majority resolve spontaneously with supportive care  



==== Snake Bite
- *Types of envenomation*:  
  - *Neurotoxic* (cobra, krait) → ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar palsy, respiratory paralysis  
  - *Vasculotoxic* (viper) → local swelling, bleeding, DIC, renal failure, shock  
  - *Myotoxic* (sea snake) → myalgia, myoglobinuria, renal failure  

- *Management*:  
  - First aid: immobilize bitten limb, reassure child, avoid tourniquet, cutting, or sucking bite site  
  - ABCs, hospitalize all suspected cases  
  - *Antisnake venom (ASV)*: indicated if systemic envenomation → neuro signs, progressive local swelling, spontaneous systemic bleeding, hematuria, shock  
  - Supportive care:  
    - Respiratory support (ventilation if paralysis)  
    - Dialysis in renal shutdown  
    - Wound care and tetanus prophylaxis  

== IMCI

*Definition*:  
*Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)* - WHO/UNICEF strategy to reduce under-5 morbidity and mortality from preventable and treatable childhood illnesses (respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, measles, malnutrition).

*Components*:  
- *Case management*: Standardized guidelines for assessment, classification, treatment, counseling of sick child  
- *Health system support*: Essential drug supply, referral linkages, monitoring/supervision  
- *Family and community practices*: Appropriate feeding, vaccination, hygiene/sanitation, compliance with treatment  


*Assessment of Sick Children*  
- *Check for General Danger Signs* (any → urgent referral/admit):  
  - Inability to drink/breastfeed  
  - Vomiting everything  
  - Convulsions  
  - Lethargy/unconsciousness  


*Main Symptoms (IMCI framework)*  

=== Cough / Difficulty Breathing  
- Ask duration of cough, presence of stridor/wheeze  
- Check respiratory rate (fast breathing → age-based cutoff: ≥50/min in 2-12 months; ≥40/min in 12-59 months)  
- Look for chest indrawing, stridor at rest  

=== Diarrhea  
- Ask duration and whether blood present  
- Assess hydration status (None / Some / Severe) based on IMCI clinical signs  

=== Fever  
- Consider endemic malaria area → test/assume malaria  
- Look for measles rash, stiff neck/meningitis signs, hepatosplenomegaly  

=== Ear problems  
- Ear pain, ear discharge, mastoid tenderness  

=== Nutritional/Micronutrient Assessment
- Check weight-for-age (growth chart or Z-score)  
- Look for visible severe wasting, edema of both feet  
- Check anemia (palmar pallor)  
- Check Vitamin A deficiency signs (Bitot's spot, xerophthalmia)  


*Classification and Treatment per IMCI*  

=== Pneumonia (Cough / Breathing problem)  
- *No pneumonia (cough/cold)* → Home care, fluids, supportive care  
- *Pneumonia* → Fast breathing only, no chest indrawing → Oral antibiotic (Amoxicillin first line) + home care  
- *Severe pneumonia / very severe disease* → Chest indrawing, stridor, danger signs → Admit, oxygen, IV antibiotics  

=== Diarrhea  
- *No dehydration* → Plan A: Home management - ORS after each stool, zinc for 14 days, maintain feeding  
- *Some dehydration* → Plan B: ORS in facility, give 75 ml/kg over 4 hrs, reassess  
- *Severe dehydration* → Plan C: IV fluids (Ringer's Lactate or NS), rapid correction, urgent referral if not improving  
- *Persistent diarrhea* → Evaluate for malnutrition, micronutrient deficiency  
- *Dysentery (blood in stool)* → Antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin as per WHO), zinc, fluids  

=== Malaria (per endemicity)  
- *Uncomplicated malaria* → Oral Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)  
- *Severe malaria* → Admit, IV Artesunate (preferred) or Quinine, treat hypoglycemia, manage seizures, fluids accordingly  

=== Measles
- Give Vitamin A supplementation  
- Identify and manage complications (pneumonia, diarrhea, stomatitis, eye infection)  

=== Ear problems  
- *Acute ear infection* → Oral antibiotic (Amoxicillin), analgesic, dry ear wicking  
- *Chronic ear discharge* → Topical antibiotic drops, avoid swimming, ENT referral if persistent  
- *Mastoiditis or danger signs* → Urgent referral  


#info_box([Before Discharge],[
- Always assess immunization and feeding in every sick child encounter  
- Counsel caregivers on feeding, home care, recognition of danger signs, and when to return immediately
