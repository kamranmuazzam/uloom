== Tinea corporis
typically presents as annular, scaly plaques with central clearing and raised borders caused most often by _Trichophyton rubrum_

Diagnosis is usually clinical; KOH mount or fungal culture can confirm in atypical or refractory cases.

Topical azoles (ketoconazole, clotrimazole) are first-line for localized disease; oral therapy is reserved for extensive or recurrent infection.

Always counsel on hygiene measures, treatment of contacts if required and continuation of treatment beyond disappearance of rash to ensure full eradication.

#table(columns:5,[Severity],[Typical Lesions],[Distribution],[Scarring],[Mainstay of Treatment],
[Mild],[Mostly comedones (blackheads/whiteheads); few small papules/pustules],[Usually face only],[None],[Topical therapy only : retinoid ± benzoyl peroxide ± mild topical antibiotic],
[Moderate],[Numerous papules and pustules, occasional comedones],[Face ± chest/back],[Minimal or none],[Topical therapy + oral antibiotic (e.g., doxycycline/minocycline)],
[Severe],[Nodules, cysts, conglobate lesions, possible sinus tracts],[Extensive (face, trunk)],[Common],[Systemic therapy : oral isotretinoin, sometimes short steroid course for inflammation],

=== Comparision between Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) and Tinea (Dermatophytosis)
#table(columns:4,[Feature],[Psoriasis],[Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema)],[Tinea (Dermatophytosis)],
[Etiopathogenesis],[Chronic immune-mediated (T-cell driven) hyperproliferation of keratinocytes],[Chronic inflammatory condition mediated by skin barrier dysfunction + atopy (IgE-related)],[Superficial fungal infection by dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton)],
[Typical Sites],[Extensor surfaces (elbows, knees), scalp, sacral area, palms/soles, nails; may be generalized],[Flexural surfaces (antecubital, popliteal fossae), neck, eyelids, wrists, ankles; infants—face/scalp],[Anywhere; often unilateral or localized (trunk, groin, feet, scalp)],
[Morphology & Borders],[Well‑defined plaques, thick silvery scales],[Ill‑defined, lichenified patches with excoriations],[Annular (ring‑like), central clearing, raised scaly edge],
[Color],[Salmon‑pink to erythematous],[Erythematous or hyperpigmented (chronic)],[Erythematous at edges, pale center],
[Itching],[Mild to moderate],[Severe / intense],[Moderate],
[Course],[Chronic, relapsing],[Chronic, relapsing (flares + remissions)],[Self‑limited if treated; may recur with reinfection],
[KOH Mount],[Negative],[Negative],[Positive for hyphae],
[Fungal Culture],[Negative],[Negative],[Positive dermatophyte growth],
[Systemic Associations],[Psoriatic arthritis, nail pitting, metabolic syndrome],[Atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis)],[Often linked to humid conditions or contact transmission],
[First‑Line Treatment],[Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs (calcipotriol), coal tar, phototherapy for extensive lesions],[Emollients, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus/pimecrolimus)],[Topical antifungals (azoles, terbinafine) for localized disease; oral antifungals if extensive],
[Systemic Therapy (when needed)],[Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Acitretin, Biologics (anti‑TNF, IL‑17, IL‑23)],[Short oral steroids, antihistamines, immunomodulators (cyclosporine, dupilumab)],[Oral terbinafine, itraconazole, or fluconazole],
[Prognosis],[Chronic; controllable but not curable],[Chronic; improves with age (often in eczema)],[Curable with proper antifungal treatment],
[Key Counseling],[Avoid triggers (trauma, stress, infection); moisturize; adherence to long‑term therapy],[Maintain skin hydration; avoid irritants; regular moisturizers; short lukewarm baths],[Keep area dry; avoid sharing towels/clothing; treat contacts if recurrent])]
