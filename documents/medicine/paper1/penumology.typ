== Pneumonia

=== Types of Pneumonia
+ Hospital-Acquired (Nosocomial) Pneumonia  
+ Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)  
+ Aspiration Pneumonia  
+ Atypical Pneumonia (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella)

=== Pathophysiology and Stages of Lobar Pneumonia

+ *Organism* (commonly *Streptococcus pneumoniae*) enters alveoli → inflammation → consolidation  
+ *Stages:*
  + *Congestion (Day 1):* Vascular engorgement, alveoli with serous exudate, numerous bacteria.  
  + *Red Hepatization (Day 2-3):* Alveoli filled with RBCs, neutrophils, fibrin → liver-like solid lung.  
  + *Gray Hepatization (Day 4-6):* Disintegration of RBCs, fibrin and WBCs persist → gray firm lung.  
  + *Resolution (After Day 7):* Enzymatic digestion of exudate → absorbed or coughed out; lung returns to normal.


=== Pneumonic Consolidation

==== Physical Features
+ Reduced chest movement/expansibility of left side  
+ Bronchial breath sounds  
+ Increased vocal resonance in left upper chest  
+ Increased vocal fremitus in left upper chest  
+ Dullness on percussion  
+ Reduced chest expansion on affected side  

==== Radiological Features
+ Homogeneous opacity with air bronchogram  
+ Sharp margins conforming to lobar boundaries  

=== Investigations
+ CBC - Raised total WBC count with neutrophilia  
+ Sputum - Gram stain and culture (*Streptococcus pneumoniae* common)  
+ Blood culture - May be positive in severe cases  
+ Chest X-ray - Lobar consolidation  
+ Pulse oximetry - May show hypoxia  

=== Community Acquired Pneumonia

==== Presentation
+ Acute fever, cough, breathlessness  
+ Rusty sputum  
+ May have pleuritic chest pain  

#info_box([Pleuritic Chest Pain],[
Pleuritic chest pain indicates pleural involvement typical in lobar pneumonia when inflammation extends to the pleural surface.  

_Presents as chest pain aggravated by respiration after a few days of fever and cough._
])

=== Differential Diagnosis of Pneumonia
+ Atelectasis  
+ Pulmonary embolism with infarction  
+ Pulmonary tuberculosis  
+ Lung carcinoma with post-obstructive collapse  
+ Pulmonary edema  
+ Lung abscess  


==== Predisposing Factors
+ Extremes of age (elderly, infants)  
+ COPD, diabetes mellitus  
+ Smoking and alcoholism  
+ Immunosuppression  
+ Viral infections (influenza) as preceding illness  

==== Management/Treatment
+ Empirical antibiotics: usually *amoxicillin-clavulanate* or *macrolides (azithromycin/clarithromycin)*  
+ Oxygen therapy if hypoxic  
+ Adequate hydration and rest  
+ Antipyretics and supportive therapy  
+ If severe — hospital admission and IV antibiotics  


=== Pneumonia Severity Scoring (CURB-65, PSI)

*CURB-65 parameters (1 point each):*  
+ *C* - Confusion  
+ *U* - Urea >7 mmol/L  
+ *R* - Respiratory rate ≥30/min  
+ *B* - Blood pressure < 90 systolic or ≤60 diastolic  
+ *65* - Age ≥65 years  

*Scoring:*  
- 0-1: Mild, outpatient treatment  
- 2: Moderate, consider admission  
- ≥3: Severe, hospital/ICU care  

*PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index):* Complex weighted score using age, comorbidities, vitals, labs, and radiological findings to stratify mortality risk.

=== Complications of Pneumonia

+ *Local:*  
  - Pleural effusion  
  - Empyema  
  - Lung abscess  
  - Bronchiectasis  

+ *Systemic:*  
  - Sepsis, shock  
  - Dissemination (meningitis, endocarditis, pericarditis)  
  - Respiratory failure

== Lung Abscess

=== Presentation
+ History of Pneumonia  
+ High fever with rigors, cough with copious foul-smelling purulent sputum  
+ May have hemoptysis  
+ Weight loss and malaise  

=== Radiological Features
+ Thick-walled cavity with air-fluid level, usually in posterior segments of upper lobe or superior segments of lower lobe  
+ Surrounding consolidation may be present
