== Respiratory Tract Infections
These are furthr classified into upper and lower respiratory tract infection.
Department of ENT focuses on URTI while LRTI are dealt in Pneumology

=== Pneumonia

==== Types of Pneumonia
+ Hospital-Acquired (Nosocomial) Pneumonia  
+ Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)  
+ Aspiration Pneumonia  
+ Atypical Pneumonia (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella)

==== Pathophysiology and Stages of Lobar Pneumonia

+ *Organism* (commonly *Streptococcus pneumoniae*) enters alveoli → inflammation → consolidation  
+ *Stages:*
  + *Congestion (Day 1):* Vascular engorgement, alveoli with serous exudate, numerous bacteria.  
  + *Red Hepatization (Day 2-3):* Alveoli filled with RBCs, neutrophils, fibrin → liver-like solid lung.  
  + *Gray Hepatization (Day 4-6):* Disintegration of RBCs, fibrin and WBCs persist → gray firm lung.  
  + *Resolution (After Day 7):* Enzymatic digestion of exudate → absorbed or coughed out; lung returns to normal.


==== Pneumonic Consolidation

*Physical Features*
+ Reduced chest movement/expansibility of left side  
+ Bronchial breath sounds  
+ Increased vocal resonance in left upper chest  
+ Increased vocal fremitus in left upper chest  
+ Dullness on percussion  
+ Reduced chest expansion on affected side  

*Radiological Features*
+ Homogeneous opacity with air bronchogram  
+ Sharp margins conforming to lobar boundaries  

==== Investigations
+ CBC - Raised total WBC count with neutrophilia  
+ Sputum - Gram stain and culture (*Streptococcus pneumoniae* common)  
+ Blood culture - May be positive in severe cases  
+ Chest X-ray - Lobar consolidation  
+ Pulse oximetry - May show hypoxia  

==== Community Acquired Pneumonia

*Presentation*
+ Acute fever, cough, breathlessness  
+ Rusty sputum  
+ May have pleuritic chest pain  

#info_box([Pleuritic Chest Pain],[
Pleuritic chest pain indicates pleural involvement typical in lobar pneumonia when inflammation extends to the pleural surface.  

_Presents as chest pain aggravated by respiration after a few days of fever and cough._
])

==== Differential Diagnosis of Pneumonia
+ Atelectasis  
+ Pulmonary embolism with infarction  
+ Pulmonary tuberculosis  
+ Lung carcinoma with post-obstructive collapse  
+ Pulmonary edema  
+ Lung abscess  


*Predisposing Factors of Pneumonia*
+ Extremes of age (elderly, infants)  
+ COPD, diabetes mellitus  
+ Smoking and alcoholism  
+ Immunosuppression  
+ Viral infections (influenza) as preceding illness  

==== Management/Treatment
+ Empirical antibiotics: usually *amoxicillin-clavulanate* or *macrolides (azithromycin/clarithromycin)*  
+ Oxygen therapy if hypoxic  
+ Adequate hydration and rest  
+ Antipyretics and supportive therapy  
+ If severe — hospital admission and IV antibiotics  


==== Pneumonia Severity Scoring (CURB-65, PSI) <pneumonia_severity_scoring>

*CURB-65 parameters (1 point each):*  
+ *C* - Confusion  
+ *U* - Urea >7 mmol/L  
+ *R* - Respiratory rate ≥30/min  
+ *B* - Blood pressure < 90 systolic or ≤60 diastolic  
+ *65* - Age ≥65 years  

*Scoring:*  
- 0-1: Mild, outpatient treatment  
- 2: Moderate, consider admission  
- ≥3: Severe, hospital/ICU care  

*PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index):* Complex weighted score using age, comorbidities, vitals, labs, and radiological findings to stratify mortality risk.

==== Complications of Pneumonia

+ *Local:*  
  - Pleural effusion  
  - Empyema  
  - Lung abscess  
  - Bronchiectasis  

+ *Systemic:*  
  - Sepsis, shock  
  - Dissemination (meningitis, endocarditis, pericarditis)  
  - Respiratory failure

=== Lung Abscess

==== Presentation
+ History of Pneumonia  
+ High fever with rigors, cough with copious foul-smelling purulent sputum  
+ May have hemoptysis  
+ Weight loss and malaise  

==== Radiological Features
+ Thick-walled cavity with air-fluid level, usually in posterior segments of upper lobe or superior segments of lower lobe  
+ Surrounding consolidation may be present  

=== Influenza
While common cold is upper tract infection, Influenza also called Flu is both URTI and LRTI. It can stay as a URTI or progress to a serious LRTI (Pneumonia). For Pneumonia it is dealt for as above and for URTI is dealth in the Department of ENT.

=== Covid-19
Pathogen: SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)

Covid-19 can present as a mild URTI or progress to severe viral Pneumonia (LRTI). As it's LRTI is in the form of severe Pneumonia, it is scored as per CURB-65(@pneumonia_severity_scoring) and dealt as such.

The virus binds to ACE-2 receptors, which are abundant not only in the lungs but also in the heart, kidneys, gut, and endothelium (lining of blood vessels). This explains the multi-system nature of the disease.

==== Staging of Covid-19
- *Asymptomatic Infection*(40%): No symptoms.
- *Mild Illness*(40% of symptomatic): URTI symptoms (fever, cough, loss of taste/smell, sore throat). No signs of pneumonia.
- *Moderate Illness*(40% of symptomatic): Clinical signs of pneumonia (e.g., on imaging) but without severe hypoxia.
- *Severe Illness*(20% of symptomatic): Severe pneumonia characterized by:
    - *Hypoxia* (low blood oxygen), often with "silent hypoxia" where the patient doesn't feel short of breath.
    - Respiratory frequency > 30 breaths/min.
    - Critical Illness: Requires ICU care. This includes:
        - *ARDS* (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): A severe form of lung failure that is a hallmark of critical COVID-19.
        - *Sepsis and Septic Shock*.
Note: _The estiamtes are of prevaccine era, these numbers are way less now._
==== Unique Complications (Beyond Pneumonia)

This is what makes COVID-19 distinct. The lung injury isn't just from the virus, but from the body's response.

- *Immunological*: "Cytokine Storm" - a dysregulated, hyper-inflammatory response that causes widespread tissue damage.
- *Cardiovascular*: High risk of blood clots (thromboembolism), leading to Pulmonary Embolism (PE), heart attacks, and strokes. Myocarditis (heart inflammation).
- *Post-Acute Sequelae*: "Long COVID" - persistent symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath) lasting weeks or months after the acute infection.

==== Clinical Management

- *Severity Scoring*: As per CURB-65 for pneumonia.
- Treatment:
    - *Antivirals* (e.g., Paxlovid) in early phase.
    - *Immunomodulators* (e.g., Dexamethasone) for severe hypoxia.
    - *Anticoagulation* (blood thinners) to prevent clots.

==== Unique Aspects:

- "*Silent Hypoxia*" is common.
- *Post-Acute Sequelae* ("*Long COVID*") is a significant concern.
=== Acute Bronchitis
Inflammation of the bronchi.

A persistent, often productive cough that lasts for up to 3 weeks. It is a clinical diagnosis based on this symptom.

Normally no signs of consolidation on exam (no pneumonia). May have wheezing or rhonchi.
=== Bronchiolitis
Inflammation and congestion of the bronchioles.

A clinical syndrome in infants (typically < 12 months) characterized by wheezing, crackles, and respiratory distress.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause.

Hyperinflation of the lungs on a chest X-ray.
=== Pleurisy
Inflammation of the pleura.

Pleuritic Chest Pain - sharp, stabbing pain that is worse on deep breathing or coughing.

Often a complication of an underlying condition, most commonly pneumonia, but also PE, viral infection, or autoimmune disease.

A pleural friction rub heard on auscultation with a stethoscope.

=== Empyema
Pus in the pleural space. It is a complicated Pleural Effusion that has become infected.

A collection of pus (not just fluid) between the lung and chest wall, often causing persistent fever and illness despite antibiotics.

A complication of pneumonia (para-pneumonic effusion that progresses) or lung abscess.

Fluid on chest X-ray/CT that is loculated (trapped in pockets) and requires drainage (via chest tube) for treatment.
