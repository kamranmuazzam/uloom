== Hepatitis
=== Acute Viral Hepatitis
- Causes: HAV (RNA, fecal-oral), HBV (DNA, sexual/blood/perinatal), HCV (RNA, blood), HDV (RNA, defective, needs HBV), HEV (RNA, fecal-oral, ↑fatal in preg.)
- Clinical: Prodrome: fatigue, malaise, anorexia, N/V, arthralgia → Icteric: dark urine, clay stool, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly
- Labs: ↑AST/ALT (>1000s, ALT > AST usually), ↑Bili, ↑ALP mild
- Complications:
    - HAV/HEV: No chronicity (HEV = fulminant ↑ esp. pregnancy)
    - HBV/HCV: Can → chronic hepatitis(_more in C_), cirrhosis, HCC
=== Serology
- *anti-HAV* *IgM* = acute infection, *IgG* = immune
- *HBsAg* = infection (present = disease, >6 mo = chronic)
- *Anti-HBs* = immune (vaccine or recovery)
- *Anti-HBc* = core infection (*IgM* = acute, *IgG* = past/chronic)
- *HBeAg* = active replication, infectivity
- *Anti-HBe* = ↓replication/low infectivity
- *“Window period”* = HBsAg neg, Anti-HBs not yet + → only IgM anti-HBc +
- *HBV DNA* = best measure of replication/activity
- *anti-HCV IgG* = past infection
- *HCV RNA PCR* = active infection
- *HBsAg* with *anti-HDV IgM* = acute infection, *IgG* = past/chronic infection
- *HBsAg with HDV RNA PCR* = active  infection (acute/chronic)
- *anti-HEV IgM* = Acute Infection, *IgG* = Past Infection

=== Chronic Hepatitis
- Definition: HBsAg or HCV RNA >6 months
- Risks: Cirrhosis → HCC
- Causes: HBV (↑risk HCC even without cirrhosis), HCV, HDV
- Monitoring: LFTs, HBsAg/HCV RNA, AFP + US q6mo for HCC screen

=== Treatment
- *HAV/HEV*: Supportive only
- *HBV*:
    - *Indications*: ↑ALT, HBV DNA >2,000, biopsy activity, cirrhosis
    - *Drugs*: Tenofovir, Entecavir (lifelong; high barrier to resistance)
- *HCV*:
    - Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) → >95% cure, 8–12 weeks
- *HDV*: Needs HBV; Tx peg-IFN (limited benefit)
- *Immunization*:
    - HAV, HBV vaccines available
- *HBV vaccine*: 3-dose series (0,1,6mo); newborns within 24h + HBIG if mom HBsAg+

Always check HCV RNA (antibody only means exposure, not active disease)
])

#info_box([Some Hooks For Hepatitis],[
- HAV = only acute, fecal‑oral, no chronic, vaccine
- HBV = DNA virus → cirrhosis + HCC (even w/o cirrhosis!)
- HCV = chronic in ~80% cases, no vaccine, DAAs → cure
- HDV = requires HBV coinfection
- HEV = epidemic, fecal‑oral, fulminant in pregnancy
- In Pregnancy : HAV, HBV and HEV (HEV main because fatal)
- Window period HBV = only IgM anti‑HBc positive
- HCC screening in chronic HBV/HCV = US + AFP q6mo
])

== Ascites
- *Cause* = ↑Portal HTN + ↓Alb + RAAS (Na/H₂O)
    - Also, Aldosterone metabolism is not functioning.
- SAAG#footnote[Serum-Ascites Albumin Gradient]: ≥1.1 = portal HTN; < 1.1 = malign/TB/pancreas
- Tx:
  - Salt Restriction : Salt < 2g diet
  - Diuretics: Spironolactone 100:40 furosemide ratio
  - For 3-5 liters : Paracentesis
  - LVP (5L+) -> Paracentesis + IV Albumin 6-8 g/L tapped over 5 liters
- Diagnostic Paracentesis and Treat SBP if ascites recurring.
- Refract.
  - TIPS#footnote[Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt] -> transplant
