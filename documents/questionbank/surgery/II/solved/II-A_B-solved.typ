= A boy of 13 year old came to you along with his father with the complains of unable to read the blackboard in his classroom if he seat at last row.
1. What is your common diagnosis?
#answer[*Diagnosis* : Myopia(nearsightedness)]
2. How will you explain the condition?
#answer[*Explaination*

the eyeball is relatively long or the cornea is too curved, causing light rays to focus in front of the retina instead of on it. As a result, distant objects (like the blackboard) appear blurred, while near vision remains clear.]
3. How will you confirm your diagnosis?
#answer[
  *Confirmation of Diagnosis*
+ Visual acuity test
  - Distance vision reduced; near vision normal.
  - Improves with concave (minus) lenses.
+ Retinoscopy / Auto‑refraction:
  - Shows parallel rays focused in front of retina.
+ Fundus examination:
  - May show temporal crescent, myopic disc, tigroid fundus in higher degrees.
]
4. What is the treatment?
#answer[*Treatment*
+ Optical correction:
  - Concave (minus) lenses — spectacles or contact lenses.
+ Refractive surgery (after age 18 if stable refractive error):
  - LASIK / PRK / SMILE.
+ Lifestyle advice:
  - Good lighting, outdoor activities, limit near work/screen time.
+ Regular follow‑up:
  - To monitor progression and retinal complications (e.g. myopic degeneration).

= A 42 year-old man came to you for the problem of reading book, but his distance vision was 6/6 in both eyes and he never used glasses.
1. What is the name of this problem?
#answer[*Diagnosis*: Presbyopia]
2. How will you treat him?
#answer[
  - Convex (plus) lenses for near work — reading glasses.
    - Bifocal or progressive lenses if distance and near correction needed together.
  - Advice: Adequate lighting for reading.
]
3. What is the pathogenesis of the condition?
#answer[
  *Pathogenesis*
  
  Age‑related loss of accommodation due to:
  - Decreased elasticity of the crystalline lens.
  - Reduced contractility of ciliary muscle.
Hence, the lens cannot increase curvature sufficiently for near focus → blurred near vision.]

#answer[*Diagnosis* : Chronic Dacryocystitis]

#answer[*Management*
+ Confirm diagnosis:
  - Regurgitation test (R.O.P.L.A. test): pressure over lacrimal sac causes mucopurulent reflux from puncta.

  - Topical antibiotic drops (e.g. chloramphenicol/fluoroquinolone).
  - Systemic antibiotics if discharge heavy.
  - Lid hygiene and warm compresses.
+ Definitive (surgical) management:
  - Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): creates drainage between lacrimal sac and nasal cavity (procedure of choice).
  - Dacryocystectomy (DCT): if DCR not suitable (elderly, poor nasal access, atrophic sac).
+ Advice:
  - Maintain facial/eyelid cleanliness.
  - Avoid eye makeup during infection.
  - Treat nasal/sinus disease if present (common association).

#answer[Acute Iridocyclitis (Anterior Uveitis)]
1. Write down the mechanism of formation of hypopyon.
#answer[*Mechanism of Formation of Hypopyon*
+ Inflammation of iris and ciliary body → breakdown of blood-aqueous barrier.

3. What is the pathogenesis of hypopyon corneal ulcer?
#answer[*Pathogenesis of Hypopyon Corneal Ulcer:*
+ Infective ulcer → destruction of corneal epithelium and stroma.
+ Inflammatory response → release of cytokines → migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into anterior chamber.
+ Breakdown of blood‑aqueous barrier → accumulation of inflammatory cells and debris as hypopyon in inferior anterior chamber.
+ Hypopyon here is sterile (non‑infective), caused by toxic and immune reactions rather than direct bacterial invasion.

4. How will you confirm your case?
#answer[*Confirmation*
1. Clinical Features (slit‑lamp exam):
  - Dry, grayish‑white ulcer with feathery margins and satellite lesions.
  - Surrounding corneal infiltration, possible immune ring.
  - Fixed, thick hypopyon (does not move with head position).
2. Laboratory Investigations:
