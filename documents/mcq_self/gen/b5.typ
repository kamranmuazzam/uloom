= Surgical Infections — Comprehensive Clinical Block 5

+ A 58-year-old diabetic with chronic renal failure develops foul discharge 3 days after catheter placement. The next step to prevent further CLABSI:
  + Remove the catheter and culture the tip for confirmation

  + *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
  + *E. coli*
  + *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
  + *Staphylococcus epidermidis*

+ In burn wound colonization, an early indicator of sepsis is:
  + Sudden change in wound color, necrosis, and systemic instability
