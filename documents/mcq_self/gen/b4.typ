= Surgical Infections — Integrated Clinical Block 4

+ A 28-year-old nitrobenzene-factory worker sustains 40 % flame burns. Within 24 h he becomes tachycardic and hypotensive with hemoconcentration. The most important initial management:
  + Aggressive fluid resuscitation using Parkland formula
  + Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics
  + Hyperbaric oxygen
  + Early eschar excision

+ The Parkland formula estimates burn fluid needs as:
  + 4 mL × %TBSA × body weight (kg) - half in first 8 h
  + 2 mL × %TBSA × body weight (kg)
  + 4 mL per hour irrespective of weight
  + 1 mL × %TBSA × hours since burn

+ In extensive burns, early infection is most commonly due to:
  + *Staphylococcus aureus* colonizing wound surface
  + *Clostridium tetani* spores
  + *Candida albicans*
  + *E. coli*

+ Which topical agent provides broad coverage including *Pseudomonas*?
  + Silver sulfadiazine
  + Mupirocin
  + Bacitracin
  + Neomycin

+ A 33-year-old presents with fever and systemic toxicity 5 days after flame burn. Burn wound shows greenish discharge with fruity odor. The likely organism:
  + *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
  + *Proteus mirabilis*
  + *Streptococcus pyogenes*
  + *Candida albicans*

+ The hallmark of burn wound sepsis:
  + Sudden color change of eschar, new eschar separation, and systemic deterioration
  + Persistent granulation
  + Mild erythema only
