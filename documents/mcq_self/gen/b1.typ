= Surgical Infections — Clinical Integration (Block 1)
---

+ == A 48-year-old man develops fever 48 h after laparotomy. His wound is tender, erythematous, but not discharging. Which of the following most correctly describes the stage of infection?
  + Contamination
  + Colonization
  + Early surgical site infection (inflammatory phase)
  + Organ/space infection

+ == In a clean-contaminated surgery such as bowel resection, the dominant organisms in early SSI are usually:
  + Skin commensals such as *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
  + Enteric Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes
  + Fungal spores
  + Viral flora

+ == A 62-year-old diabetic with poor glycemic control undergoes hernia repair. Postoperatively, he develops wound infection with *Staphylococcus aureus*. His increased susceptibility is mainly due to:
  + Hyperglycemia impairing neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis
  + Insulin excess boosting bacterial proliferation
  + Improved vascularity of adipose tissue
  + Enhanced fibroblast activity

+ == In surgical prophylaxis, the key pharmacologic principle is to:
  + Achieve bactericidal tissue levels at the time of potential contamination
  + Administer antibiotics only after closure
  + Use broad-spectrum antibiotics for five days
  + Delay prophylaxis until infection occurs

+ == A 70-year-old man develops purulent wound discharge 4 days after colectomy. Which of the following defines a *deep incisional* SSI?
  + Infection limited to the dermis and subcutis
  + Involvement of fascia or muscle layers below the incision
  + Any infection beyond 30 days
  + Positive cultures without discharge

+ == A 25-year-old woman with appendectomy wound pain and fever is found to have pus beneath the aponeurosis of external oblique. The infection is best categorized as:
  + Superficial incisional SSI
  + Deep incisional SSI
  + Organ/space SSI
  + Contaminated wound only

+ == A clean wound such as hernia repair ideally requires which prophylaxis?
  + Cefazolin given within 60 min before incision
  + Vancomycin 24 h prior
  + Metronidazole infusion only
  + No antibiotic at all

+ == A 40-year-old man presents with rapidly spreading erythema and severe pain in the thigh following minor trauma. There is subcutaneous crepitus and systemic toxicity. Initial management priority is:
  + Urgent surgical exploration and debridement
  + Wait for tissue culture results
  + Start topical antiseptics only
  + Apply ice packs and elevation

+ == The presence of “dish-water pus” in surgery most characteristically indicates:
  + Necrotizing fasciitis
  + Cellulitis
  + Simple abscess
  + Tuberculous cold abscess

+ == A 37-year-old female with breast abscess reports throbbing pain and a fluctuant swelling. The appropriate surgical principle is:
  + Incision and drainage at the most dependent point
  + Aspiration alone irrespective of size
  + Leave to rupture spontaneously
  + Close primarily without drainage

+ == A 60-year-old man presents with recurrent perianal abscesses. The underlying etiology to investigate is:
  + Obstructed anal gland infection
  + Hemorrhoids
  + Diverticulitis
  + Urinary tract infection

+ == A chronic abscess that develops in cervical region without acute inflammation most likely suggests:
  + Tuberculous cold abscess
  + Acute staphylococcal abscess
  + Pyogenic granuloma
  + Suppurative lymphadenitis

+ == Which best differentiates cellulitis from abscess?
  + Cellulitis is diffuse, non-fluctuant, and lacks a pus cavity
  + Cellulitis always forms a localized lump
  + Abscess lacks systemic symptoms
  + Cellulitis heals without erythema

+ == The main etiologic agent in streptococcal cellulitis is:
  + Group A β-hemolytic *Streptococcus*
  + *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
  + *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
  + *Clostridium perfringens*

+ == Cellulitis extending from a facial furuncle may lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis through:
  + Venous drainage of the facial “danger triangle”
  + Arterial spread
  + Direct lymphatic pathway
  + Airway contamination

+ == Which of the following is a hallmark of necrotizing fasciitis compared with cellulitis?
  + Severe pain out of proportion to local findings
  + Absence of systemic toxicity
  + Well-circumscribed erythema
  + Lack of skin necrosis

+ == In suspected necrotizing fasciitis, the most important immediate step after resuscitation is:

  + *Clostridium perfringens*
  + *S. aureus*
  + *E. coli*
  + *Candida albicans*

+ == In gas gangrene, tissue destruction occurs primarily due to:
  + Exotoxins causing myonecrosis and hemolysis
  + Direct viral infiltration
  + Enzymatic hemorrhage only
  + Endotoxin-mediated shock alone

+ == Hyperbaric oxygen supports gas gangrene management by:
  + Inhibiting anaerobic metabolism and improving leukocyte function
  + Inactivating aerobic bacteria
  + Decreasing wound perfusion
  + Promoting edema formation

+ == “Ubi pus, ibi evacua” emphasizes which principle of surgical infection control?
  + Drain all collections of pus promptly
  + Aspirate only if fluctuation is uncertain
  + Treat all infections medically first
  + Avoid exploration until imaging

+ == A 70-year-old man with peripheral arterial occlusion develops black, dry, shrunken toes with clear demarcation. Diagnosis:
  + Dry gangrene
  + Wet gangrene
  + Gas gangrene
  + Frostbite

+ == For dry gangrene, the initial surgical plan should be:
  + Allow demarcation before amputation
  + Immediate debridement
  + Revascularize without assessment
  + Apply wet dressings early

+ == In wet gangrene, immediate amputation rather than delayed removal is indicated because:
  + Active infection and sepsis risk demand source control
  + Dry necrosis prevents spread
  + It improves cosmetic outcome
  + Reperfusion may worsen ischemia

+ == MRSA infections in surgical wards are prevented primarily by:
  + Rigorous hand hygiene and contact precautions
  + Universal antibiotic prophylaxis
  + Air filters only
  + Cohorting all patients together

+ == A major host determinant delaying wound healing after infection control is:
  + Protein-energy malnutrition
  + Hyperoxia
  + Low cortisol
  + Hypothyroidism alone

+ == A 49-year-old post-appendectomy patient presents 6 days later with high fever and diffuse tenderness. Ultrasound reveals a localized pelvic fluid collection. Optimal management:
  + Image-guided drainage and culture-based antibiotics
  + Prolonged empirical antibiotics only
  + Observation and reabsorption
  + Exploratory laparotomy for all collections

+ == In necrotizing fasciitis, “LRINEC” score is used for:
  + Risk prediction based on laboratory parameters
  + Bacterial strain identification

  + Deep fascial necrosis with systemic toxicity
  + Simple cellulitis
  + Subcutaneous edema only
  + Non-infective lymphedema

+ == For high-risk trauma surgery, peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis should cover:
  + Gram-negative rods and anaerobes with piperacillin-tazobactam
  + Gram-positive cocci only
  + Fungi only
  + Tuberculous bacilli

+ == A 28-year-old clean soft-tissue wound develops purulent infection 5 days later. The most probable source is:
  + Break in aseptic technique and endogenous skin flora
  + Airborne viral infection
  + Transplacental transmission
  + Mycotic colonization

+ == Which of the following mechanisms explains higher infection risk in obese surgical patients?
  + Poor vascularity of adipose tissue and greater wound tension
  + Enhanced macrophage response
  + Increased antibiotic penetration
  + Reduced operative duration

+ == A patient with peripheral neuropathy and cellulitis over the heel is predisposed to ulceration primarily because:
  + Sensory loss masks trauma and pressure injury
  + Increased collagen deposition
  + Enhanced epidermal growth
  + Improved perfusion

+ == After incision and drainage of an abscess, the most important step for continued local management is:
  + Daily sterile dressing with assessment of granulation
  + Immediate closure
  + Topical steroids
  + Leaving wound open indefinitely

+ == Which of the following organisms typically causes mixed anaerobic infections in intra-abdominal abscesses?
  + *Bacteroides fragilis*
  + *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
  + *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
  + *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

+ == The first sign suggesting transition of cellulitis into necrotizing infection is:
  + Early anesthesia of skin (loss of sensation)
  + Pruritus
  + Granulation
  + Peeling of epidermis only

+ == A 45-year-old obese male post-colectomy has prolonged bleeding and hematoma within the wound. This predisposes to SSI because:
  + Hematoma acts as medium promoting bacterial growth
  + Hematoma sterilizes the wound
  + Coagulated blood reduces tension
  + It prevents pus formation

+ == A perineal NSTI in a diabetic patient is termed:
  + Fournier’s gangrene
  + Ludwig’s angina
  + Erythrasma
  + Meleney’s ulcer

+ == Which microbe combination is characteristic for Fournier’s gangrene?
  + Mixed aerobic and anaerobic gut flora
  + Fungal agents only
  + Viruses alone
  + Spirochetes

+ == The presence of bullae with purple-black skin patches in NSTI reflects:
  + Subcutaneous vascular thrombosis
  + Primary viral hemorrhage
  + Allergic vasculitis
  + Superficial blistering

+ == The best tool to differentiate necrotizing fasciitis from simple cellulitis in uncertain cases is:
  + Urgent surgical exploration (“finger test”)
  + MRI always before intervention
  + CT after antibiotic course
  + Only Gram stain

+ == Postoperative fever occurring within 48 h of surgery is most often due to:
  + Atelectasis or transfusion reaction
  + Surgical site infection
  + Catheter infection
  + Parasitic invasion

+ == A patient with uncontrolled diabetes develops recurrent furuncles. First-line systemic antibiotic:
  + Cloxacillin (anti-staphylococcal)
  + Ampicillin without coverage
  + Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone
  + Metronidazole

+ == Squeezing a boil on the face is dangerous because it can lead to:
  + Cavernous sinus thrombosis
  + Parotitis
  + Thyroiditis
  + Tracheitis

+ == During surgical wound closure, which step minimizes infection risk most effectively?
  + Copious irrigation and layered closure with good hemostasis
  + Tight closure to eliminate dead space
  + Avoid prophylactic antibiotics
  + Using non-absorbable sutures always

+ == A 35-year-old patient develops erythema and drainage along a surgical drain site. Best immediate step:
  + Remove the drain under aseptic conditions
  + Continue for 10 days
  + Apply topical antibiotic around it
  + Ignore unless febrile

+ == Which host factor contributes *least* to SSI development?
  + Well-controlled immunity and adequate nutrition
  + Diabetes mellitus
  + Malnutrition
  + Corticosteroid therapy

+ == A 55-year-old woman after hysterectomy reports purulent pelvic drain output. Culture reveals mixed anaerobes. Appropriate antibiotic regimen:
  + Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole
  + Penicillin alone
  + Vancomycin only
  + Macrolide

+ == Debridement in infected wound aims to:
  + Remove dead tissue preventing granulation and bacterial persistence
  + Stimulate scar hypertrophy
  + Reduce need for antibiotics
  + Delay epithelialization

+ == A contaminated wound with fecal soilage should be defined as:

  + Dirty wound (already infected)

+ == Hemodynamic instability in NSTI before surgery should be managed by:
  + Aggressive IV fluids and hemodynamic support
  + Oral fluids
  + Immediate closure of wound
  + Ice packs

+ == Optimal postoperative wound care after debridement for infection consists of:
  + Regular wound inspection, sterile dressing, and early nutrition
  + Leaving open without cover
  + Suturing under tension
  + Compression bandage

+ == Which infection requires surgical rather than medical cure?
  + Acute abscess (Ubi pus, ibi evacua)
  + Cellulitis without pus
  + Viral paronychia
  + Drug rash

+ == The bacterial trio often responsible for necrotizing soft-tissue infections (Type I) includes:
  + Anaerobes, enteric Gram-negatives, and streptococci
  + *Mycobacterium* spp. only
  + *Neisseria* and fungi
  + Viruses

+ == A clue suggesting deep sepsis rather than superficial SSI is:
  + Persistent fever after superficial wound healing
  + Mild erythema only
  + No systemic signs
  + Rapid resolution within hours
