= Haemorrhage
Extravasation of Blood#footnote[don't mention blood vessel#shomiron] is called Haemorrhage#shomiron 
== Classification
Following are various ways to calssify haemorrhage.#shomiron #viva 
=== Clinical Classification
- *Primary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding during surgery or trauma.
- *Reactionary Haemorrhage*
  - Within 24 hours after surgery#footnote[in ENT this is within 7-14#footnote[before 7 days and after 24 hours is classified as primary haemorrhage#shomiron] days, basically within the time vascular repair occurs].
- *Secondary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding occurs after 7-14 days of surgery#footnote[in ENT this is after 7-14 days, basically after the time vascular repair occurs].

=== According to Source
- Arterial Haemorrhage
- Venous Haemorrhage
- Capillary Haemorrhage

=== According to onset
- Acute
- Chronic

== Reactionary Haemorrhage <reactionary-haemorrhage>
Example#shomiron
- Tonsillectomy
- Thyroidectomy
- Prostatectomy
- Circumcision
- Haemorrhoidectomy

*Cause of Reactionary Haemorrhage
*
After reversal of anesthesia, pressure increase and the following causes might cause haemorrhage
- Slipping of ligature
- Dislodgement of clot

Reactionary Haemorrhage happens in operations where vascularity, collateral circulation is more

== Secondary Haemorrhage
The main cause of Secondary haemorrhage is infection, which causes sloughing out of the blood vessel wall.
It occurs mainly in surgery such as
- Tonsillectomy
- Porstatectomy

#info_box([
  *Occurance of Untrontrolled Bleeding*
],[
  - Coagulation Disorder (Drug Induced)
  - Blood Cancer
])

== Haemostasis
Spontaneous arrest of bleeding is called haemostasis#shomiron.

This requires some precondition, Platelelts. Also, platelets in the blood don't cause coagulation all the time without haemorrhage, because there are natural anticoagulants and vessel wall is normal.

=== Techniques of Haemostasis
The techniques of Haemorrhage are#viva #written
+ Pressure and Packing#footnote[using Gauze for 6-10 minites(clotting time)]
+ Elevation
+ Tourniquet
+ Diathermy and Cauterization
+ Ligature (Large vessel)
+ Clipping (Laparoscopic Surgery)
+ Applicatiion of ultrasonic haemostatic device#footnote[New, Harmonic Scapel, it vibrates 55k times per second. This causes heat coagulation.]


#info_box([
  *Torniquet should be applied in the single bone.*
],[
  For example, in case of bleeding from radial artery, torniquet should be applied to arm, not the forearm. This is because the pressure applied on the supposedly proximal part of radial artery will not occlude it because of it's communication in the interosseaus space. While pressure applied to the arm will directly reach the brachial artery.

=== Basic Principles of control of Haemorrhage
The basic principles of control of Haemorrhage are#written

Control of Haemorrhage is vital to prevent *shock*.

==== Immediate / Temporary Control
- Direct pressure - most effective.
- Elevation - limb above heart level ↓pressure.
- Pressure points - compress proximal artery.
- Tourniquet - only if bleeding uncontrolled; temporary use.
- Temporary surgical methods - artery forceps on bleeding point.

==== Definitive / Surgical Control
- Ligature - tie vessel with suture.
- Torsion - twist small bleeding vessels.
- Vessel repair (angiorrhaphy) - suture wall.
- Electrocautery / diathermy - coagulate.
- Topical agents - gelatin sponge, oxidized cellulose, fibrin glue.

==== General / Physiological Measures
- Replace blood loss - fluids, transfusion.
- Correct coagulopathy - Vit K, FFP, platelets.
- Avoid hypothermia - maintain temperature.
- Monitor BP, oxygenation, urine output.

*Mnemonic*:
*PRESS* → Pressure, Raise limb, Escharotics (cautery), Suture/ligation, Support circulation.

*Summary:*  
Control haemorrhage by
+ *temporary measures*(pressure, elevation, torniquete)
+ *definitive surgical methods*(ligature, vessel repair), and
+ *correction of systemic factors*(blood transfusion, vitamin K, prevent hypothermia).
