= Haemorrhage
Extravasation of Blood#footnote[don't mention blood vessel#shomiron] is called Haemorrhage#shomiron 
== Classification
Following are various ways to calssify haemorrhage.#shomiron #viva 
=== Clinical Classification
- *Primary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding during surgery or trauma.
- *Reactionary Haemorrhage*
  - Within 24 hours after surgery#footnote[in ENT this is within 7-14#footnote[before 7 days and after 24 hours is classified as primary haemorrhage#shomiron] days, basically within the time vascular repair occurs].
- *Secondary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding occurs after 7-14 days of surgery#footnote[in ENT this is after 7-14 days, basically after the time vascular repair occurs].

=== According to Source
- Arterial Haemorrhage
- Venous Haemorrhage
- Capillary Haemorrhage

 - Accident
 - Trauma
 - Gum Bleeding
 - Epistaxis
 - Hematemesis
 - Hemoptysis

=== According to onset
- Acute
- Chronic

== Reactionary Haemorrhage <reactionary-haemorrhage>
Example#shomiron
- Tonsillectomy
- Thyroidectomy
- Prostatectomy
- Circumcision
- Haemorrhoidectomy

*Cause of Reactionary Haemorrhage
*
After reversal of anesthesia, pressure increase and the following causes might cause haemorrhage
- Slipping of ligature
- Dislodgement of clot

Reactionary Haemorrhage happens in operations where vascularity, collateral circulation is more

== Secondary Haemorrhage
The main cause of Secondary haemorrhage is infection, which causes sloughing out of the blood vessel wall.
It occurs mainly in surgery such as
- Tonsillectomy
- Porstatectomy

])

#info_box([
  *Occurance of Untrontrolled Bleeding*
],[
  - Coagulation Disorder (Drug Induced)
  - Blood Cancer
])

== Haemostasis
Spontaneous arrest of bleeding is called haemostasis#shomiron.

This requires some precondition, Platelelts. Also, platelets in the blood don't cause coagulation all the time without haemorrhage, because there are natural anticoagulants and vessel wall is normal.

=== Techniques of Haemostasis
The techniques of Haemorrhage are#viva #written
+ Pressure and Packing#footnote[using Gauze for 6-10 minites(clotting time)]
+ Elevation
+ Tourniquet
+ Diathermy and Cauterization
+ Ligature (Large vessel)
+ Clipping (Laparoscopic Surgery)
+ Applicatiion of ultrasonic haemostatic device#footnote[New, Harmonic Scapel, it vibrates 55k times per second. This causes heat coagulation.]


#info_box([
  *Torniquet should be applied in the single bone.*
],[
  For example, in case of bleeding from radial artery, torniquet should be applied to arm, not the forearm. This is because the pressure applied on the supposedly proximal part of radial artery will not occlude it because of it's communication in the interosseaus space. While pressure applied to the arm will directly reach the brachial artery.
])
=== Basic Principles of control of Haemorrhage
The basic principles of control of Haemorrhage are#written

Control of Haemorrhage is vital to prevent *shock*.

==== Immediate / Temporary Control
- Direct pressure - most effective.
- Elevation - limb above heart level ↓pressure.
- Pressure points - compress proximal artery.
- Tourniquet - only if bleeding uncontrolled; temporary use.
- Temporary surgical methods - artery forceps on bleeding point.

==== Definitive / Surgical Control
- Ligature - tie vessel with suture.
- Torsion - twist small bleeding vessels.
- Vessel repair (angiorrhaphy) - suture wall.
- Electrocautery / diathermy - coagulate.
- Topical agents - gelatin sponge, oxidized cellulose, fibrin glue.

==== General / Physiological Measures
- Replace blood loss - fluids, transfusion.
- Correct coagulopathy - Vit K, FFP, platelets.
- Avoid hypothermia - maintain temperature.
- Monitor BP, oxygenation, urine output.

*Mnemonic*:
*PRESS* → Pressure, Raise limb, Escharotics (cautery), Suture/ligation, Support circulation.

*Summary:*  
Control haemorrhage by
+ *temporary measures*(pressure, elevation, torniquete)
+ *definitive surgical methods*(ligature, vessel repair), and
+ *correction of systemic factors*(blood transfusion, vitamin K, prevent hypothermia).

= Transfusion

== Common Blood Products
The commonly transfused blood products are mentioned below#viva.
- Whole Blood - acute severe blood loss
- Packed RBC - anemia, blood loss (improves #ce("O2") capacity)
- Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) - coagulation factor deficiency, DIC, massive transfusion
- Platelets - thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, bleeding
- Cryoprecipitate - fibrinogen deficiency, Factor VIII, Factor XIII, vWD
- Albumin - hypoproteinemia, burns, shock

== Indications
- Acute blood loss > 20% blood volume
- Severe symptomatic anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL, or < 8 in cardiac disease)
- Coagulopathy, DIC, warfarin toxicity (FFP)
- Thrombocytopenia with bleeding or platelet < 10-20k
- Hypofibrinogenemia (< 100 mg/dL) - Cryoprecipitate

== Contraindications
- Not for volume replacement alone (use crystalloids/colloids)
- Iron-deficiency anemia without hemodynamic instability
- Hematinic deficiency anemia (B12/Folate) unless acute or severe
- Congestive Heart Failure - risk of overload (use cautiously)

== Transfusion Order (Single Unit)

- Confirm patient ID - name, age, hospital/bed number
- Blood grouping and cross-matching
- Check donor unit details and expiry date
- Bedside re-check of patient and unit
- Start slow rate (first 15 min), observe for reaction
- Monitor vitals - before, 15 min, hourly, and post-transfusion


== Complications
Following are the complications of Blood Transfusion#viva

*Immediate*:
- Hemolytic reaction (ABO mismatch) - fever, chills, hypotension, back pain
- Febrile non-hemolytic reaction
- Allergic - urticaria, anaphylaxis
- Septic shock (contaminated blood)
- TRALI - Transfusion-related acute lung injury

*Delayed*:
- Delayed hemolysis
- Blood-borne infections - HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, malaria
- Iron overload
- Graft-vs-Host disease

== Screening of Blood Transfusion
- ABO and Rh grouping, cross-match
- Infectious disease screening: HIV, HBV, HCV, Syphilis, Malaria (region dependent)

== Massive Blood Transfusion

=== Definition
Following are the definitions of massive Blood Transfusion#viva.
- Replacement of > 1 blood volume in 24 hr or,
- > 50% blood volume in 3 hr or,
- > 10 units in 24 hr

=== Precautions
Following precautions are to be taken before Massive Blood Transfusion#viva.
- Warm blood before transfusion
- Use screened, leucocyte-depleted components
- Monitor coagulation, #ce("Ca^2+"), electrolytes
- Prefer component therapy over whole blood

=== Complications
Following are the complications of Massive Blood Transfusion#viva.
- Dilutional coagulopathy
- Citrate toxicity - hypocalcemia
- Electrolyte imbalance - hypo/hyperkalemia
- Hypothermia
- Acid-base disturbances

== Mismatched Blood Transfusion

=== Features/Consequences
- Immediate fever, chills, tachycardia, hypotension
- Chest/back pain, hemoglobinuria, acute renal failure
- Shock, DIC

=== Prevention
- Strict patient ID verification
- Proper grouping and cross-matching
- Bedside re-check before transfusion

=== Management
Mismatched Blood transfusion is to be managed in the following steps#viva.
- Stop transfusion immediately
- Maintain IV access with normal saline
- Supportive: fluids, diuretics (forced diuresis), treat shock
- Monitor urine output, renal function, manage DIC if present


= Fluid, Electrolytes, Acid-Base Balance and Nutrition

Common Intravenous Solutions used in Surgical Practice are:
- 5% Dextrose (D5): energy, no electrolytes.
- Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl): volume expansion, corrects hyponatremia.
- Ringer’s Lactate (RL): balanced fluid, preferred for resuscitation.
- Dextrose Normal Saline (DNS): energy + sodium chloride.
- Potassium-containing fluids: added if adequate urine output.

== Post Operative Fluid Regimen#viva
- *Operative Day*: 5% Dextrose in Aqua (DA), 1 L.  
- *1st POD*: Dextrose Normal Saline (DNS), 2 L.  
- *2nd POD*: Dextrose Normal Saline (DNS) 2L + KCl 20 mEq (if urine output adequate).  

*Rationale for this choice is as follows*#viva.  
- On the operative day, due to surgical trauma stress is present, the body retains salt and water (↑ ADH and aldosterone), so electrolyte-free and less fluid is preferred.  
- On the 1st POD, the stress response begins to subside, but K⁺ remains high from tissue breakdown; thus K⁺ is avoided.  
- On the 2nd POD, K⁺ stores are depleted and supplementation is needed.  
- Fluids should always be adjusted according to urine output and patient condition.

== Hypokalemia#viva
=== Correction
- Mild: oral KCl supplements.
- Severe: IV KCl (20-40 mEq/L) slowly, with ECG monitoring.
- Check urine output before replacement.

=== Monitoring
- Serial serum K+ levels every 6-8 h.
- Continuous ECG for arrhythmias.

== Hyperkalemia
=== Causes
- Renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hemolysis, burns, excessive K+ intake, drugs (ACE inhibitors).

=== Dangers
- Fatal arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle paralysis, respiratory failure.

== Central Venous Line
- Inserted into internal jugular/subclavian vein.
- Used for CVP monitoring, TPN, irritant drugs, long-term fluids.
- Complications: infection, thrombosis, pneumothorax, air embolism.
- CVP < 5 cm H₂O → hypovolemia; >12 cm H₂O → overload.

== Metabolic Acidosis
- Definition: pH < 7.35, HCO₃⁻ < 22 mEq/L.
- Causes: shock, renal failure, DKA, lactic acidosis, diarrhea.
- Symptoms: Kussmaul respiration, confusion, arrhythmia.
- Treatment: correct underlying cause, IV bicarbonate if severe (pH< 7.1).

== Total Parenteral Nutrition
- Delivered via central line when GI tract unusable.
- Contains glucose, amino acids, lipids, electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements.
- Indications: prolonged ileus, bowel obstruction, short gut, severe pancreatitis.
- Complications: infection, hyperglycemia, liver dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance.
- Monitor: weight, glucose, liver function, electrolytes.

= Shock

== Definition#viva
- Acute circulatory failure causing inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery to cells.

== Types#viva
+ Hypovolemic (blood/fluid loss)
+ Cardiogenic (pump failure)
+ Distributive (vasodilation: septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic)
+ Obstructive (tamponade, PE, tension pneumothorax)

== Monitoring During Resuscitation#viva
- BP (MAP)
- HR
- Sp#ce("O2")
- urine output
- CVP
- mental status
- lactate
- capillary refill.

== Hypovolemic Shock
Surgical Causes of Hypovolemic Shock#viva.
- Hemorrhage (trauma, ruptured aneurysm, GI bleed)

=== Principles of Treatment of Hypovolemic Shock
- ABCs: Airway, Breathing, Circulation.
- Control bleeding.
- Rapid volume replacement: crystalloids → blood if needed.
- Oxygen therapy.
- Monitor urine, vital signs, CVP.
- Correct acidosis and electrolyte imbalance.


== Septic Shock
- Hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion due to infection despite fluid resuscitation.
- Mechanism: endotoxin-induced vasodilation, ↑ permeability, ↓ myocardial contractility.
- Clinical: fever/hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia, warm→cold peripheries.
- Treatment: fluids, vasopressors (norepinephrine), antibiotics, source control.

== SIRS
- Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.
- Diagnostic criteria (any 2 of):
  - Temp >38°C or < 36°C
  - HR >90/min
  - RR >20/min or PaCO₂ < 32 mmHg
  - WBC >12,000 or < 4,000/mm³ or >10% bands.
