= Rectal Carcinoma
== Causes
+ Commonest in old age group(now common in younger patients).
+ Western country disease(2nd after Breast Cancer), but it is common in south asia because of westernization of food.
+ Familial disease now.
+ Intake of fatty food
 - Vegetable বেশি intake করতে বলে, কারণ vegetable plant এ lignin থাকে
 - Human lignin : anti-carcinogenic, that’s why bowel softening and frequency of bowel movement এ help করে
 - Plant lignin টা converted হয়ে যায় human lignin এ upon entering the colon.
 - Fat -> Constipation করে সাথে থাকে bile salt which is carcinogenic 
+ Ulcerative Colitis(Pre-malignant condition)
+ FAP gene
+ FPP coli (Familial Polyposis coli)
+ Rectal Polyp (Adenocarcinoma) consequence
 - যদি colon  এ adenoma থাকে পরে carcinoma হবে 
 - Polyp থাকলে ফেলে দিতে হবে।
+ Radiation

#info_box([],[Constipation হলে colorectal mucosa তে অনেক সময় থাকে, তাই high incidence of malignancy])

#info_box([Length],[
Rectal Length : 12.8 cm

Anal Canal Length : 3.8 cm
])

== Classification
=== Macroscopically
+ Ulcerative
+ Cauliflower
+ Annular
+ Tubular

=== Based on Part of Rectum
- Upper 1/3rd (most common) : Annular, Tubular Variety
- Middle 1/3rd : Cauliflower
- Lower 1/3rd : Ulcerative

== Presentation
*Ulcerative*: Perectal Bleeding, Mucous Discharge

*Cauliflower*: Tenesmus/morning weeping
- takes 6 months to involve quarter of circumference
- takes 12-18 months to involve full crcumference

*Annular Tubular*
+ Alteration of Bowel Habit
+ Spurious Diarrhoea
+ Subacute Intestinal Obstruction
+ Acute Intestine Obstruction (This is when full circumference is involved)

#info_box([],[There is no weight loss, anorexia in Ca of Anal Canal])

== Investigations
+ DRE
+ Proctoscopy

=== Investigation Findings
*DRE*
+ Whether there is any ulcer present or not
+ How far is the ulcer from anal verge
+ Location of verge, whether on the anteriror or posterior wall of the rectum
+ Margin (Regular or Irregular)a
+ Fixity of ulcer
+ Whether you can reach the upper limit of ucler or not
+ After removal of finger blood stained mucus present or not
*Procto-Sigmoidoscopy and Biopsy*
- 12 cm (can be seen on both DRE and Proctoscopy)
- Sigmoidoscope
 - Rigid: upto 25 cm from anal verge
 - Flexible: upto 40 cm from anal verge
- Colonoscope allows upto 160 cm from anal verge

Then after getting malignant report, do (3) staging process of disease.
== Staging
*Staging Methods*
+ TNM
+ Dukes
== DUKE Staging
*Stage A*: Disease Process/malignancy confined to rectal wall
*Stage B*: Malignancy involved the para rectal tissue
*Stage C*: Lymph node involvement
- *Stage C1*: Pararectal lymph node
- *Stage C2*: The lymph node involved the root of the supplying vessels
*Stage D*: Distant Metastasis (Blood borne)
- Liver
- Lung
- Bone
- Brain

#info_box([Ways of Metastasis],[
- Local Invasion
- Lymphatic
- Blood Borne
- Transcoelomic
])

== Investigations Done for Staging
- Xray Chest (Lung metastasis)
- USG of abdomen (Liver and para aortic Lymph node, ascites দেখে)
- Liver function test
 - Serum bilirubin X
 - γ glutamyl transferase raise করবে (Liver metastasis)
- MRI of pelvis (to see extension)
- Transrectal USG (Local extension of disease)
- Tumor markers
 - Serum CEA level (Carcinoembryogenic Antigen)
  - Non Smoker : 0-5 ng/ml
  - Smoker : 0-10 ng/ml
 - Monitoring করে এটা দেখে, but no diagnostic and prognostic value
- Colonoscopy: To see the synchronous lesion (Multiple primary lesion)
- CBC

#info_box([Synchronous Lesion],[
Simultaneous presence of multiple lesion in two different places
])

#info_box([Recurrence],[
After successful treatment reappearance of disease process in previous surgery site/previous anastomotic site.
])

== Treatment
After Diagnosis, a tumor board is formed
=== Surgery (Curative Intervention if Possible)
There are two options
+ Anteiror Resection
+ Posterior Resection

The general principle is to resect healthy tissue to keep clear margin, 6-10 cm proximally and 2 cm distally.
==== Anterior Resection
This is done if the carcinoma doesn't invovle the anal sphincter.
The carcinoma along with lymph nodes are removed and the remaining healthy gut is anastomosed.

==== Abdominoprineal Resection
This is done if the carcinoma involves the anal sphincter. So, the anal sphincter cannot be preserved. Even if the carcinoma is within 2 cm of anal sphincter, it cannot be preserved because 2 cm of healthy margin is to be resected. Here a permanent colostomy is performed after removal of carcinoma and lymph nodes.

This is basically done by following two methods, Pelvic exenteration and Pelvic eventeration.
===== Pelvic Eventeration
Everything is resected
- Rectum
- Anal Canal
- Ovary
- Uterus
- Prostate
- Bladder
===== Pelvic Exenteration
Iliac bone is also removed by chiseling.
=== Palliative Treatment

== Follow up
= DRE
== Findings of DRE
- Rectal mucosa
- If prostate is enlarged or not (M)
- Painful cervix (F)
- Tip of coccyx (both)
