== Sepsis and Septic Shock
Refer for this section in @septic-shock
== Boil
*Definition*#written#viva: Acute staphylococcal infection of a single hair follicle with perifolliculitis.  
=== Etiology
*Causative Organism*#viva: _Staphylococcus aureus_ (often from nasal carriage or skin abrasions).

*Predisposing factors*
- Poor hygiene
- Diabetes mellitus
- Malnutrition
- Immunosuppression
- Skin friction
=== Clinical Features
#written
- Common Sites: face, neck, axilla, buttocks, thighs.
- Red, tender, indurated nodule → becomes fluctuant → points and discharges pus.
- Local lymphadenitis may occur.
- Fever may accompany multiple boils (furunculosis).
=== Management
#written
+ Local care
  - Warm compresses for pain and to promote pointing.
  - Incision and drainage (I&D) once fluctuant.
  - Avoid squeezing → spreads infection and risk of carbuncle, esp. on face → can lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis.
+ Antibiotics
  - Cloxacillin or Cephalexin — for staphylococcal coverage.
+ Supportive measures
  - Hygiene improvement
  - Control of diabetes
  - Treat underlying cause.
== Carbuncle
*Definition*#viva#written A carbuncle is a deep-seated staphylococcal infection of a group of hair follicles with interconnecting abscesses in the subcutaneous tissue, commonly at the nape of neck in diabetics.  

=== Etiology
*Causative Organism*: _Staphylococcus aureus_

*Predisposing Factors*
- Diabetes mellitus (most common)
- Male patients, especially nape of neck
- Poor hygiene
- Obesity
- Malnutrition

=== Clinical Features
#written
- Common site: back of neck, upper back, scapular region, buttocks.
- Starts as a painful indurated swelling → becomes larger and more tense.
- Multiple pustular openings give "sieve-like" appearance.
- Surrounding skin: red, edematous, tender.
- May be accompanied by fever, malaise, and toxemia.

=== Complications
#written
+ Sepsis
+ Cellulitis or abscess formation
+ Spread to bloodstream → septicemia
+ In the face → cavernous sinus thrombosis (a feared complication)
+ Chronic scarring after healing
=== Management
#written
+ *Systemic*
- IV anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (e.g., Cloxacillin, Cefazolin; for MRSA, Vancomycin or Linezolid)
- Control of diabetes (check blood sugar, start insulin if diabetic)
- Antipyretics, fluids, nutritional support.
+ *Local*
- Incision and drainage with cruciate incisions once fluctuant.
- Debridement of necrotic tissue.
- Warm compresses in early stages to localize infection.
+ *Post-healing care*
- Maintain hygiene, treat underlying conditions.
== Abscess
*Definition*#shomiron#viva:An abscess is a localized collection of pus within a closed tissue cavity surrounded by a pyogenic membrane composed of dead neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic tissue.

=== Types
+ Acute abscess
  - Rapid development, intensely painful, hot, and tender.
  - Commonly staphylococcal.
  - Example: Furuncle, subcutaneous abscess.
+  Chronic abscess
  - Develops slowly, less tender, thick wall.
  - Commonly tuberculous or actinomycotic.
  - Example: Cold abscess from tuberculosis.
+ Based on site
  - Superficial: Subcutaneous, breast, axilla.
  - Deep: Liver, brain, perianal, pelvic abscess, etc.
=== Clinical Stages
#figure(table(
  columns: 2,
  [Stage],[Events & Symptoms],
  [Invasion Stage],[Bacteria invade tissue → inflammatory response → redness, warmth, induration, pain → “cellulitis stage.” or suppuration stage of abscess],
  [Collection (Suppuration) Stage],[Tissue necrosis → pus formation → becomes fluctuant → throbbing pain.],
  [Pointing and rupture],[Pus moves towards surface; skin becomes thin and yellow → may spontaneously rupture or need incision.]
),caption: [Clinical Stages of an Acute Abscess])
=== Principles of Treatment
+ *Local Treatment*
  - Incision and Drainage (I&D): (_Ubi pus, ibi evacua_ ;drain wherever pus collects)
  - The golden rule — “Ubi pus, ibi evacua” (Where there is pus, evacuate it).
  - Make incision in the most dependent part and along skin creases for better drainage and cosmetic healing.
  - Break loculi, irrigate cavity, insert drain or wick if necessary.
+ *Systemic Management*
  - Antibiotics: Anti-staphylococcal for acute abscesses.
  - Analgesics, fluids, rest.
+ *Investigate & Treat Underlying Causes*
  - Diabetes, immunosuppression, foreign body, obstruction (perianal abscess often due to blocked anal gland).
=== Examples of Some Abscess
- Appendicular abscess
- Liver abscess
- Perianal abscess
- Breast abscess
_The principle of treatment is the same._
== Cellulitis
*Definition*#written:Diffuse, spreading infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by acute inflammation without localization of pus.

=== Causative Organisms
- Group A $beta$-hemolytic Streptococci (most common)
- _Staphylococcus aureus_ can also cause localized forms.
=== Pathophysiology
- Organisms enter through minor breaches (cuts, ulcers, abrasions).
- Spread occurs along subcutaneous tissue planes, making lesions diffuse and ill-defined.
=== Clinical Features
- *Onset*: Sudden, often with fever, malaise, chills.
- *Local signs*: Hot, red, swollen, tender area with ill-defined margins; skin tense and shiny.
- *Consistency*: Firm, no fluctuation (→ helps distinguish from abscess).
- *Pain*: Severe, throbbing, localized.
- *Systemic signs*: Fever, lymphangitis, regional lymphadenitis.
- *Common sites*: Lower limb, face (esp. periorbital region).

)
=== Complications
- Spread to deeper planes → fasciitis, gangrene
- Sepsis
- Thrombophlebitis
- Chronic lymphedema (due to lymphatic destruction)
=== Management
+ *General*
  - Rest and limb elevation.
  - Analgesics, antipyretics.
+ *Antibiotics*
  - IV penicillin or cefazolin (for streptococcal infections).
  - If Staph suspected, add Cloxacillin or a cephalosporin.
  - For diabetic/complicated cellulitis → IV Amoxiclav, Ceftriaxone, or Vancomycin (if MRSA risk).
+ *Local Care*
  - Mark margins to monitor progression.
  - Warm compresses.
  - If abscess formation suspected → imaging (USG) and surgical drainage.
== Gangrene
*Definiton*#written : Gangrene is the death of tissue in mass (macroscopic level) associated with loss of blood supply and putrefaction.


=== Pathophysiology
- Ischemia / loss of blood supply → lack of oxygen & nutrients.
- Cell death (necrosis) begins → tissue breakdown.
- Bacterial invasion may superimpose → toxin release & further spread.
- The process can remain dry (mummified) or become wet (moist and infected).

=== Types
#written
#figure(table(
columns:3,
[Type],[Cause / Mechanism],[Characteristics],
[Dry gangrene],[Arterial occlusion (e.g., atherosclerosis, embolism)],[
- Mummified, dry, black tissue

- No clear demarcation
- Rapidly spreads.],
[Gas gangrene],[Anaerobic infection (Clostridium perfringens) after trauma],[- Crepitus, brownish discharge, profound toxemia, rapid progression.],
[Specific forms:],[],[
- Noma (face, malnutrition)
- Fournier’s gangrene (perineum/scrotum)]
),caption:[Types of Gangrene and Basic Description])
=== Management
+ *General Measures*
  - Resuscitation — fluids, correct anemia, control diabetes, antibiotics.
  - Broad-spectrum antibiotics early (cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobes) — e.g. Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole.
  - Local Measures
+ *Dry gangrene*
  - Keep dry, protect from infection.
  - Allow natural line of demarcation → amputation when patient stable and demarcation clear.
+ *Wet / Gas gangrene*
  - Urgent surgical debridement or amputation — life over limb.
  - For gas gangrene → radical excision, high-flow oxygen (hyperbaric if available), IV Penicillin + Clindamycin + Metronidazole.
+ *Supportive*
  - Analgesia, nutrition, diabetic & vascular optimization.

== Tetanus
*Definition*: Tetanus is a spastic paralytic disease caused by the neurotoxin (tetanospasmin) produced by Clostridium tetani, an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus.

=== Etiology
#written
- Arterial obstruction (atherosclerosis, embolism, trauma).  
- Venous obstruction (torsion, thrombosis).  
- Infection (Clostridium spp., streptococcal).  
- Diabetes mellitus.  
- Frostbite, burns, chemical injury.  
=== Pathogenesis
- Spores enter through contaminated wounds, burns, umbilical stump, or injections.
- Under anaerobic conditions → spores germinate → release tetanospasmin.
- The toxin travels via nerve endings, reaching the CNS, where it blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA, glycine) → unopposed muscle contraction and spasm.
=== Clinical Features
Incubation Period: 3-21 days
- *Early signs*: Trismus (“lockjaw”), neck stiffness, dysphagia.
- *Facial involvement*: Risus sardonicus - grim, fixed smile due to facial spasm.
- *Generalized spasms*: Opisthotonus (arching of back), abdominal rigidity.
- *Other features*: Painful spasms triggered by light, sound, touch; preserved sensorium.
- *Autonomic dysfunction*: Tachycardia, fluctuating BP, sweating, arrhythmias (severe cases).
=== Diagnosis
- Clinical — no laboratory test confirms tetanus.
- History of wound + characteristic spasms = diagnostic.
=== Management
+ *Neutralize Unbound Toxin*
  - Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000-6000 IU IM (or equine ATS if TIG unavailable).
+ *Prevent Further Toxin Production*
  - Wound debridement — remove necrotic tissue and source of anaerobic growth.
  - *Antibiotics*:
    - Metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h (preferred).
    - Penicillin G is also effective but may exacerbate spasms (GABA antagonism).
+ *Control Muscle Spasms*
  - Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) to sedate and relax muscles.
  - Magnesium sulfate (in ICU settings) may help reduce autonomic instability.
  - Tracheostomy may be required for airway protection if spasms severe.
+ *Supportive Care*
  - Quiet, dark room (minimal stimuli).
  - Nutrition via NG tube.
  - Maintain airway, monitor vitals.
+ *Active Immunization*
  - Tetanus toxoid given during recovery (disease does not confer immunity).
=== Prognosis
Mortality remains high if untreated (up to 80%), but with modern intensive care, survival > 85% is possible in well-managed patients.

_Spasms reverse and Trismus goes last, weeks to months_
== Wound
*Definition*: A wound is a break in the continuity of tissue, whether caused by trauma or surgical incision, with or without loss of structure or function.

=== Classification of Wound
+ *Based on Etiology / Cause*
  - *Traumatic*: Incised, lacerated, contused, penetrating, crush injuries
  - *Surgical (Incised / Clean)*: Planned incisions under aseptic conditions
  - *Infective*: Abscess, carbuncle
  - *Pathological*: Malignant ulcer, tuberculous sinus
+ *Based on Contamination (ATLS Classification)*
  - *Clean*: Elective surgery, no entry into GI/respiratory/urinary tracts
  - *Clean-contaminated*: Controlled entry into GI/respiratory/urinary tracts
  - *Contaminated*: Fresh traumatic wounds (< 4 h old) or major breach in asepsis
  - *Dirty / Infected*: Old traumatic wounds >4-6 h, devitalized tissue, pus present
=== Types of Healing
#figure(table(
  columns: 3,
[Type],[Description],[Example],
[Primary intention (First intention)],[Clean wound, edges neatly approximated with sutures → minimal tissue loss, minimal scar],[Surgical incision],
[Secondary intention],[Large tissue loss or infection → wound left open → fills by granulation tissue, contraction, epithelialization],[Ulcer, abscess cavity],
[Tertiary intention (Delayed primary)],[Initially open (due to contamination), later closed after infection control],[Contaminated traumatic wound]
),caption: [Types of Wound Healing])

=== Phases / Stages of Wound Healing
+ *Inflammatory phase (0-3 days)*
  - Hemostasis + inflammation (vasodilation, migration of neutrophils, macrophages).
+ *Proliferative (Fibroblastic) phase (3-10 days)*
  - Fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, re-epithelialization begins.
+ *Maturation (Remodeling) phase (from day 10 → weeks/months)*
  - Collagen reorganizes, wound contracts, scar strengthens.
#info_box([When Tissue is Granulating#shomiron],[
- Reduced features of acute inflammation  
- Absence of pus or slough  
- Appearance of pinkish granulation tissue  
- Bleeds on touch
])
=== Factors Delaying Wound Healing
==== Local Factors
  - *Infection*: Most common — prolongs inflammation, causes tissue necrosis.
  - *Poor blood supply / ischemia*: ↓ Oxygen & nutrient delivery → delayed fibroblast and epithelial activity.
  - *Mechanical stress / movement*: Disrupts granulation tissue and suture line.
  - *Edema / hematoma*: Increases tension and impairs perfusion.
  - *Foreign body (necrotic tissue, sutures)*: Acts as nidus for infection.
  - *Radiation*: Damages microvasculature and fibroblasts, causing hypoxia.
  - *Local malignancy*: Poor vascularity, necrosis in the wound bed.
==== Systemic Factors
  - *Age*: Elderly → reduced cellular activity.
  - *Anemia / Hypoproteinemia*: Less oxygen and substrate for repair.
  - *Malnutrition*: Protein & vitamin C deficiency impair collagen synthesis.
  - *Diabetes mellitus*: Impaired leukocyte function, microvascular disease, infection risk.
  - *Drugs*: Steroids, cytotoxics → inhibit inflammation and collagen synthesis.
  - *Jaundice / Uremia*: Toxin accumulation → interferes with healing.
  - *Shock / Hypovolemia*: ↓ Tissue perfusion.
  - *Systemic infection / sepsis*: Catabolic state, requires body resources to fight infection.
==== Prevention / Correction
_Treat the cause before it affects wound_
- *Strict asepsis*, wound toilet.
- *Good hemostasis* to prevent hematoma.
- *Adequate rest and immobilization*
- *Optimize systemic health* — correct anemia, control diabetes, improve nutrition.
- *High-protein, vitamin-rich diet* (Vitamin C, Zinc, A).
- *Stop steroids / cytotoxic drugs* if possible.

=== Complications of Wound Healing
==== Local Complications
  + *Wound infection*: Most common; causes pus, delayed healing, possibly abscess formation.
  + *Wound dehiscence (burst abdomen)*: Failure of wound closure due to infection, poor suturing, raised intra-abdominal pressure (classically 7-10 days post-op).
  + *Hematoma / Seroma*: Collection of blood or serum under wound → tension, infection risk.
  + *Retained foreign body or necrotic tissue*: Acts as nidus for infection.
  + *Scarring abnormalities*:
    - Hypertrophic scar: within wound margin, may regress.
    - Keloid: beyond original wound, may persist, itchy, recurs after excision.
  + *Sinus or fistula formation*: Persistent discharge tract from chronic infection or foreign body.
  + *Chronic non-healing ulcer*: Due to ischemia, neuropathy, or malignancy transformation (Marjolin ulcer).
==== Systemic Complications
  + *Complication*: Description
  + *Bacteremia / Septicemia*: Spread of bacteria systemically → high fever, rigors, hypotension, possibly septic shock.
  + *Tetanus and gas gangrene*: In contaminated or neglected wounds (especially deep punctured wounds).
  + *Multi-organ failure*: From severe sepsis or toxemia.
  + *Scarring contractures (functional impairment)*: Especially around joints, leading to limited movement.
  + *Malignant change (Marjolin ulcer)*: Rare; squamous cell carcinoma developing in chronic scar or ulcer.
