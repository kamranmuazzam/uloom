== Sepsis and Septic Shock
Refer for this section in @septic-shock
== Boil
definition
=== Etiology
*Causative Organism*: _Staphylococcus aureus_ (often from nasal carriage or skin abrasions).
*Predisposing factors*: Poor hygiene, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, immunosuppression, skin friction.
=== Clinical Features
- Common sites: face, neck, axilla, buttocks, thighs.
- Red, tender, indurated nodule → becomes fluctuant → points and discharges pus.
- Local lymphadenitis may occur.
- Fever may accompany multiple boils (furunculosis).
=== Management
+ Local care
  - Warm compresses for pain and to promote pointing.
  - Incision and drainage (I&D) once fluctuant.
  - Avoid squeezing (as you correctly noted) → spreads infection and risk of carbuncle, esp. on face → can lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis.
+ Antibiotics
  - Cloxacillin or Cephalexin — for staphylococcal coverage.
+ Supportive measures
  - Hygiene improvement, control of diabetes, treat underlying cause.
== Carbuncle
definition
=== Etiology
*Causative Organism*: _Staphylococcus aureus_

*Predisposing Factors*
- Diabetes mellitus (most common)
- Male patients, especially nape of neck
- Poor hygiene, obesity, malnutrition

=== Clinical Features
- Common site: back of neck, upper back, scapular region, buttocks.
- Starts as a painful indurated swelling → becomes larger and more tense.
- Multiple pustular openings give "sieve-like" appearance.
- Surrounding skin: red, edematous, tender.
- May be accompanied by fever, malaise, and toxemia.

=== Complications
+ Sepsis
+ Cellulitis or abscess formation
+ Spread to bloodstream → septicemia
+ In the face → cavernous sinus thrombosis (a feared complication)
+ Chronic scarring after healing
=== Management
+ *Systemic*
- IV anti-staphylococcal antibiotics (e.g., Cloxacillin, Cefazolin; for MRSA, Vancomycin or Linezolid)
- Control of diabetes (check blood sugar, start insulin if diabetic)
- Antipyretics, fluids, nutritional support.
+ *Local*
- Incision and drainage with cruciate incisions once fluctuant.
- Debridement of necrotic tissue.
- Warm compresses in early stages to localize infection.
+ *Post-healing care*
- Maintain hygiene, treat underlying conditions.
== Abscess
definition
=== Types
+ Acute abscess
  - Rapid development, intensely painful, hot, and tender.
  - Commonly staphylococcal.
  - Example: Furuncle, subcutaneous abscess.
+  Chronic abscess
  - Develops slowly, less tender, thick wall.
  - Commonly tuberculous or actinomycotic.
  - Example: Cold abscess from tuberculosis.
+ Based on site
  - Superficial: Subcutaneous, breast, axilla.
  - Deep: Liver, brain, perianal, pelvic abscess, etc.
=== Clinical Stages
#figure(table(
  columns: 2,
  [Stage],[Events & Symptoms],
  [Invasion Stage],[Bacteria invade tissue → inflammatory response → redness, warmth, induration, pain → “cellulitis stage.”],
  [Collection (Suppuration) Stage],[Tissue necrosis → pus formation → becomes fluctuant → throbbing pain.],
  [Pointing and rupture],[Pus moves towards surface; skin becomes thin and yellow → may spontaneously rupture or need incision.]
),caption: [Clinical Stages of an Acute Abscess])
=== Principles of Treatment
+ *Local Treatment*
  - Incision and Drainage (I&D): (_Ubi pus, ibi evacua_ drain wherever pus collects)
  - The golden rule — “Ubi pus, ibi evacua” (Where there is pus, evacuate it).
  - Make incision in the most dependent part and along skin creases for better drainage and cosmetic healing.
  - Break loculi, irrigate cavity, insert drain or wick if necessary.
+ *Systemic Management*
  - Antibiotics: Anti‑staphylococcal for acute abscesses.
  - Analgesics, fluids, rest.
+ Investigate & Treat Underlying Causes
  - Diabetes, immunosuppression, foreign body, obstruction (perianal abscess often due to blocked anal gland).
=== Examples of Some Abscess
- Appendicular abscess
- liver abscess
- perianal abscess
- breast abscess
_The principle of treatment is the same._
== Cellulitis
definition
=== Causative Organisms
- Group A β‑hemolytic Streptococci (most common)
- _Staphylococcus aureus_ can also cause localized forms.
=== Pathophysiology
- Organisms enter through minor breaches (cuts, ulcers, abrasions).
- Spread occurs along subcutaneous tissue planes, making lesions diffuse and ill‑defined.
=== Clinical Features
- *Onset*: Sudden, often with fever, malaise, chills.
- *Local signs*: Hot, red, swollen, tender area with ill‑defined margins; skin tense and shiny.
- *Consistency*: Firm, no fluctuation (→ helps distinguish from abscess).
- *Pain*: Severe, throbbing, localized.
- *Systemic signs*: Fever, lymphangitis, regional lymphadenitis.
- *Common sites*: Lower limb, face (esp. periorbital region).

)
=== Complications
- Spread to deeper planes → fasciitis, gangrene
- Sepsis
- Thrombophlebitis
- Chronic lymphedema (due to lymphatic destruction)
=== Management
+ *General*
  - Rest and limb elevation.
  - Analgesics, antipyretics.
+ *Antibiotics*
  - IV penicillin or cefazolin (for streptococcal infections).
  - If Staph suspected, add Cloxacillin or a cephalosporin.
  - For diabetic/complicated cellulitis → IV Amoxiclav, Ceftriaxone, or Vancomycin (if MRSA risk).
+ *Local Care*
  - Mark margins to monitor progression.
  - Warm compresses.
  - If abscess formation suspected → imaging (USG) and surgical drainage.
== Gangrene
definiton : Gangrene is death of tissue in part of the body, usually associated with loss of blood supply, and visible grossly (macroscopically).
It often involves putrefaction of tissue (decomposition due to bacterial action).

=== Pathophysiology
- Ischemia / loss of blood supply → lack of oxygen & nutrients.
- Cell death (necrosis) begins → tissue breakdown.
- Bacterial invasion may superimpose → toxin release & further spread.
- The process can remain dry (mummified) or become wet (moist and infected).

=== Types
#figure(table(
columns:3,
[Type],[Cause / Mechanism],[Characteristics],
[Dry gangrene],[Arterial occlusion (e.g., atherosclerosis, embolism)],[
- Mummified, dry, black tissue
- Clear line of demarcation
- Minimal infection
- Seen in toes/fingers of diabetics or elderly.],
[Wet gangrene],[Infection + venous obstruction (e.g., bedsore, bowel strangulation)],[
- Swollen, soft, foul‑smelling
- No clear demarcation
- Rapidly spreads.],
[Gas gangrene],[Anaerobic infection (Clostridium perfringens) after trauma],[- Crepitus, brownish discharge, profound toxemia, rapid progression.],
[Specific forms:],[],[
- Noma (face, malnutrition)
- Fournier’s gangrene (perineum/scrotum)]
),caption:[Types of Gangrene and Basic Description])
=== Management
+ *General Measures*
  - Resuscitation — fluids, correct anemia, control diabetes, antibiotics.
  - Broad‑spectrum antibiotics early (cover Gram‑positive, Gram‑negative, anaerobes) — e.g. Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole.
  - Local Measures
+ *Dry gangrene*
  - Keep dry, protect from infection.
  - Allow natural line of demarcation → amputation when patient stable and demarcation clear.
+ *Wet / Gas gangrene*
  - Urgent surgical debridement or amputation — life over limb.
  - For gas gangrene → radical excision, high‑flow oxygen (hyperbaric if available), IV Penicillin + Clindamycin + Metronidazole.
+ *Supportive*
  - Analgesia, nutrition, diabetic & vascular optimization.
For Fournier’s Gangrene refer to @NSTI
== Tetanus
definition : Tetanus is a spastic paralytic disease caused by the neurotoxin (tetanospasmin) produced by Clostridium tetani, an obligate anaerobic, spore‑forming bacillus.

=== Etiology and Pathogenesis
- Spores enter through contaminated wounds, burns, umbilical stump, or injections.
- Under anaerobic conditions → spores germinate → release tetanospasmin.
- The toxin travels via nerve endings, reaching the CNS, where it blocks inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA, glycine) → unopposed muscle contraction and spasm.
=== Clinical Features
Incubation Features
- *Stage / Sign*: Description
- *Early signs*: Trismus (“lockjaw”), neck stiffness, dysphagia.
- *Facial involvement*: Risus sardonicus – grim, fixed smile due to facial spasm.
- *Generalized spasms*: Opisthotonus (arching of back), abdominal rigidity.
- *Other features*: Painful spasms triggered by light, sound, touch; preserved sensorium.
- *Autonomic dysfunction*: Tachycardia, fluctuating BP, sweating, arrhythmias (severe cases).
=== Diagnosis
- Clinical — no laboratory test confirms tetanus.
- History of wound + characteristic spasms = diagnostic.
=== Management
+ *Neutralize Unbound Toxin*
  - 
  - Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000–6000 IU IM (or equine ATS if TIG unavailable).
+ *Prevent Further Toxin Production*
  - 
  - Wound debridement — remove necrotic tissue and source of anaerobic growth.
  - *Antibiotics*:
    - Metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h (preferred).
    - Penicillin G is also effective but may exacerbate spasms (GABA antagonism).
+ *Control Muscle Spasms*
  - 
  - Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) to sedate and relax muscles.
  - Magnesium sulfate (in ICU settings) may help reduce autonomic instability.
  - Tracheostomy may be required for airway protection if spasms severe.
+ *Supportive Care*
  - 
  - Quiet, dark room (minimal stimuli).
  - Nutrition via NG tube.
  - Maintain airway, monitor vitals.
+ *Active Immunization*
  - 
  - Tetanus toxoid given during recovery (disease does not confer immunity).
=== Prognosis
Mortality remains high if untreated (up to 80%), but with modern intensive care, survival > 85% is possible in well-managed patients.
== Wound
definition : A wound is a break in the continuity of tissue, whether caused by trauma or surgical incision, with or without loss of structure or function.

=== Classification of Wound
+ *Based on Etiology / Cause*
  - *Type*: Example
  - *Traumatic*: Incised, lacerated, contused, penetrating, crush injuries
  - *Surgical (Incised / Clean)*: Planned incisions under aseptic conditions
  - *Infective*: Abscess, carbuncle
  - *Pathological*: Malignant ulcer, tuberculous sinus
+ *Based on Contamination (ATLS Classification)*
  - *Clean*: Elective surgery, no entry into GI/respiratory/urinary tracts
  - *Clean‑contaminated*: Controlled entry into GI/respiratory/urinary tracts
  - *Contaminated*: Fresh traumatic wounds (< 4 h old) or major breach in asepsis
  - *Dirty / Infected*: Old traumatic wounds >4–6 h, devitalized tissue, pus present
=== Types of Healing
#figure(table(
  columns: 3,
[Type],[Description],[Example],
[Primary intention (First intention)],[Clean wound, edges neatly approximated with sutures → minimal tissue loss, minimal scar],[Surgical incision],
[Secondary intention],[Large tissue loss or infection → wound left open → fills by granulation tissue, contraction, epithelialization],[Ulcer, abscess cavity],
[Tertiary intention (Delayed primary)],[Initially open (due to contamination), later closed after infection control],[Contaminated traumatic wound]
),caption: [Types of Wound Healing])

=== Phases / Stages of Wound Healing
+ *Inflammatory phase (0–3 days)*
  - Hemostasis + inflammation (vasodilation, migration of neutrophils, macrophages).
+ *Proliferative (Fibroblastic) phase (3–10 days)*
  - Fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, re‑epithelialization begins.
+ *Maturation (Remodeling) phase (from day 10 → weeks/months)*
  - Collagen reorganizes, wound contracts, scar strengthens.

=== Factors Delaying Wound Healing
==== Local Factors
  - *Factor*: Mechanism / Effect
  - *Infection*: Most common — prolongs inflammation, causes tissue necrosis.
  - *Poor blood supply / ischemia*: ↓ Oxygen & nutrient delivery → delayed fibroblast and epithelial activity.
  - *Mechanical stress / movement*: Disrupts granulation tissue and suture line.
  - *Edema / hematoma*: Increases tension and impairs perfusion.
  - *Foreign body (necrotic tissue, sutures)*: Acts as nidus for infection.
  - *Radiation*: Damages microvasculature and fibroblasts, causing hypoxia.
  - *Local malignancy*: Poor vascularity, necrosis in the wound bed.
==== Systemic Factors
  - *Factor*: Mechanism / Example
  - *Age*: Elderly → reduced cellular activity.
  - *Anemia / Hypoproteinemia*: Less oxygen and substrate for repair.
  - *Malnutrition*: Protein & vitamin C deficiency impair collagen synthesis.
  - *Diabetes mellitus*: Impaired leukocyte function, microvascular disease, infection risk.
  - *Drugs*: Steroids, cytotoxics → inhibit inflammation and collagen synthesis.
  - *Jaundice / Uremia*: Toxin accumulation → interferes with healing.
  - *Shock / Hypovolemia*: ↓ Tissue perfusion.
  - *Systemic infection / sepsis*: Catabolic state, requires body resources to fight infection.
==== Prevention / Correction
_Treat the cause before it affects wound_
- *Strict asepsis*, wound toilet.
- *Good hemostasis* to prevent hematoma.
- *Adequate rest and immobilization*
- *Optimize systemic health* — correct anemia, control diabetes, improve nutrition.
- *High-protein, vitamin-rich diet* (Vitamin C, Zinc, A).
- *Stop steroids / cytotoxic drugs* if possible.

=== Complications of Wound Healing
==== Local Complications
  + *Complication*: Description / Consequence
  + *Wound infection*: Most common; causes pus, delayed healing, possibly abscess formation.
  + *Wound dehiscence (burst abdomen)*: Failure of wound closure due to infection, poor suturing, raised intra‑abdominal pressure (classically 7–10 days post‑op).
  + *Hematoma / Seroma*: Collection of blood or serum under wound → tension, infection risk.
  + *Retained foreign body or necrotic tissue*: Acts as nidus for infection.
  + *Scarring abnormalities*:
    - Hypertrophic scar: within wound margin, may regress.
    - Keloid: beyond original wound, may persist, itchy, recurs after excision.
  + *Sinus or fistula formation*: Persistent discharge tract from chronic infection or foreign body.
  + *Chronic non‑healing ulcer*: Due to ischemia, neuropathy, or malignancy transformation (Marjolin ulcer).
==== Systemic Complications
  + *Complication*: Description
  + *Bacteremia / Septicemia*: Spread of bacteria systemically → high fever, rigors, hypotension, possibly septic shock.
  + *Tetanus and gas gangrene*: In contaminated or neglected wounds (especially deep punctured wounds).
  + *Multi‑organ failure*: From severe sepsis or toxemia.
  + *Scarring contractures (functional impairment)*: Especially around joints, leading to limited movement.
  + *Malignant change (Marjolin ulcer)*: Rare; squamous cell carcinoma developing in chronic scar or ulcer.
