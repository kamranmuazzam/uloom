= Asepsis, Antisepsis, Sterilization and Disinfection
== Asepsis
definition: A state free from pathogenic microorganisms in a given field or object.
→ _It is a practice or condition, not a process._

*Goal*: Prevent infection by excluding microorganisms before they contaminate wounds or instruments.

*Example*: Surgical handwashing, wearing sterile gloves, using sterile drapes.

== Antisepsis
definition: The application of chemical agents (antiseptics) to living tissues (e.g., skin, mucous membrane) to reduce or eliminate microorganisms but not necessarily spores.

=== Common Antiseptics
- Povidone‑iodine,
- Chlorhexidine,
- Alcohol (spirit, isopropyl),
- Hydrogen peroxide.

*Example*: Skin prep before incision, cleaning wounds.

=== Sterilization
definiction: The complete destruction of all forms of microbial life, including bacterial spores, viruses, and fungi, from an object or surface.

*Applies to*: Surgical instruments, dressings, implants

==== Methods of Sterilization
#figure(table(
columns: 4,
[Method],[Principle / Agent],[Used For],[Notes],
[Autoclaving (Steam under pressure)],[Moist heat at 121 °C, 15 psi, 15–30 min],[Surgical instruments, linen, dressings],[Most reliable & widely used method],
[Hot Air Oven (Dry heat)],[160–170 °C for 1 hr],[Glassware, metal instruments],[Not for plastics or rubber],
[Ethylene Oxide Gas Sterilization],[Alkylation of proteins at 37–55 °C],[Heat‑sensitive items (catheters, endoscopes, sutures)],[Requires aeration after use],
[gamma Irradiation],[Cobalt‑60 radiation],[Disposable plastic items (syringes, catheters)],[Industrial use],
[Plasma (Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma)],[Reactive plasma species destroy microbes],[Optical instruments, delicate plastics],[Fast, low‑temp; replaces EtO in some hospitals],
[Chemical Sterilization],[Glutaraldehyde (Cidex), formaldehyde, peracetic acid],[Endoscopes, delicate instruments],[Prolonged contact needed (6–10 h for spores)],

== Disinfection
Destruction of pathogens excluding spores on inanimate objects (e.g., sodium hypochlorite for tables, Lysol for floors).
