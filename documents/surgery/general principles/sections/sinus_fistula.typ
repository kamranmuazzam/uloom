= Sinus & Fistula
== Sinus
A blind‑ending epithelium‑lined tract that opens onto an epithelial surface — usually due to chronic infection, foreign body, or necrotic tissue. It does not connect two epithelial surfaces.
=== Causes
- *Chronic infection*: Boil, carbuncle, osteomyelitis → discharging sinus
- *Retained foreign body*: Suture, sequestrum, non‑absorbable material
- *Tuberculosis*: Cold abscess with draining sinus
- *Congenital*: Preauricular sinus, pilonidal sinus
== Fistula
An abnormal communication between two epithelial (or endothelial) surfaces, lined by granulation tissue. It may be internal or external.
=== Causes
- *Congenital*: Branchial fistula, thyroglossal fistula
- *Traumatic / surgical*: Bile duct injury → biliary fistula; intestinal anastomotic leak
- *Inflammatory*: Fistula‑in‑ano (due to anorectal abscess)
- *Malignant*: Carcinoma eroding into adjacent structures (e.g., rectovesical, tracheoesophageal fistula)
- *Radiation injury*: Tissue necrosis with communication
=== Classification
- *Internal*: Between two hollow viscera (e.g., colovesical fistula)
- *External*: Between a hollow viscus and skin (e.g., enterocutaneous)
- *Complex*: Multiple tracts, difficult to close (e.g., Crohn’s disease)

== Pathophysiology
- Both have persistent granulation tissue that prevents closure.
- Discharge may be pus, bile, urine, feces, or CSF depending on site.
== Management Principles
+ *Identify and treat underlying cause*
  - Control infection (antibiotics, drainage).
  - Remove foreign body or necrotic bone (in sinus).
  - Correct distal obstruction (especially in fistulae).
+ *Promote closure*
  - Curettage or excision of tract to remove unhealthy lining → allows granulating surfaces to adhere and fibrose
  - Ensure dependent drainage so no accumulation.
+ *Optimize patient condition*
  - Nutrition, control of diabetes, treat anemia.
+ *Specific measures*
  - Use fistulogram / imaging to delineate tract before surgery.
  - In selected internal fistulae: may close spontaneously once sepsis and obstruction are relieved.
