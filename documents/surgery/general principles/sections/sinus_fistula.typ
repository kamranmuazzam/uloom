= Sinus & Fistula

== Sinus
*Definition*#viva: A blind-ending epithelium-lined tract that opens onto an epithelial surface. 

=== Causes
#viva
- *Chronic infection*: Boil, carbuncle, osteomyelitis → discharging sinus
- *Retained foreign body*: Suture, sequestrum, non-absorbable material
- *Tuberculosis*: Cold abscess with draining sinus
- *Congenital*: Preauricular sinus, pilonidal sinus

=== Types
- *Congenital*: developmental defect (e.g., preauricular)
- *Acquired*: following infection, trauma, or foreign body
  - Pilonidal Sinus
  - TB Sinus
  - Median Mental Sinus
  - actinomycosis

=== Complications
- Persistent discharge and secondary infection
- Marjolin’s ulcer (squamous cell carcinoma in chronic sinus)
- Spread to adjacent tissues such as bone or muscle

== Fistula
*Definition*: An abnormal communication between two epithelial-lined surfaces. #written #viva

=== Causes
- *Congenital*: Branchial, thyroglossal
- *Traumatic / surgical*: Anastomotic leak, biliary or urinary fistula
- *Inflammatory*: Fistula-in-ano, Crohn’s disease
- *Malignant*: Carcinoma eroding into adjacent structures (e.g., rectovesical)
- *Radiation injury*: Secondary to tissue necrosis

=== Classification
- *Internal*: Between two hollow viscera (colovesical, tracheoesophageal)
- *External*: Between a viscus and skin (enterocutaneous, biliary)
- *Complex*: Multiple tracts (Crohn’s), difficult to close

=== Pathophysiology
- Persistent granulation and epithelial lining prevent closure.
- Discharge varies: pus, bile, urine, feces, CSF.
- *Factors preventing closure*: Infection, foreign body, distal obstruction, 
  epithelialization, malignancy, radiation damage, poor nutrition.

=== Investigations
- Clinical examination and characterization of discharge
- *Sinogram / fistulogram* to delineate tract
- *CT/MRI* for complex or deep fistulae
- *Culture & sensitivity* of discharge
- Assessment for distal obstruction

=== Complications
- Fluid and electrolyte imbalance (especially high-output fistulae)
- Sepsis
- Malnutrition

== Management Principles

+ *Identify and treat underlying cause*
  - Control infection (antibiotics, drainage)
  - Remove foreign body or necrotic tissue (sinus)
  - Correct distal obstruction (fistula)

+ *Promote closure*
  - Curettage or excision of tract to remove unhealthy lining
  - Ensure adequate external drainage; avoid abscess formation

+ *Optimize patient condition*
  - Correct nutritional deficiencies
  - Control diabetes, treat anemia, maintain fluid/electrolyte balance

+ *Specific measures*
  - *Imaging-guided delineation* of tract before surgery
  - *Enterocutaneous fistula management*: “SNAP” principles — 
    - Sepsis control
    - Nutrition
    - Anatomy definition
    - Plan for closure
  - Selected internal fistulae may close spontaneously once sepsis and obstruction relieved

== Prognosis
- More likely to close spontaneously if:
  - No distal obstruction
  - No foreign body or epithelial lining
  - Low-output and short tract
  - Adequate nutrition and sepsis control
