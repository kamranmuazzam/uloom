= Suture
A suture is a stitch or strand of material used to approximate tissues or ligate blood vessels during surgery.

== Classification of Sutures

+ *Based on Behavior in Tissue*
  - Absorbable
    - Natural: Catgut (plain, chromic)
    - Synthetic: Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), Polyglycolic acid (Dexon), Poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl), Polydioxanone (PDS)
  - Non-absorbable
    - Natural: Silk, Linen
    - Synthetic: Nylon, Polyester (Ethibond), Polypropylene (Prolene), Stainless steel wire
+ *Based on Source*
  - Natural
    - Catgut, silk, linen
  - Synthetic
    - Vicryl, PDS, Prolene, Nylon
+ *Based on Structure*
  - Monofilament
    - Single strand → less tissue drag, less infection; harder to handle, knots may slip (e.g., Prolene, Nylon)
  - Multifilament/Braided
    - More pliable and strong; higher tissue drag and infection risk (e.g., Silk, Vicryl, Ethibond)
+ Based on Size
  - Gauged by USP system → Thicker = smaller number (e.g., 0, 1),
  _Thinner = larger number with more zeros (e.g., 3‑0, 4‑0)._
    - Skin: usually 3‑0 to 4‑0 nylon
    - Muscle / fascia: 1 or 2‑0 Vicryl
    - Blood vessels: 6‑0 to 8‑0 Prolene

== Principles of Handling Sutures
- Handle gently with needle holder, not fingers.
- Avoid excessive tension; tissues should be approximated, not strangulated.
- Place even bites at equal distance from edges.
- Minimum number of knots with adequate security.
- Maintain sterile technique.
- Remove skin sutures at correct time — usually 5–10 days depending on site.
