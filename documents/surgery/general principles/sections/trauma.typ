=== Adjuncts to Primary Survey
+ *Monitoring*: pulse oximetry, ECG, BP, urinary catheter, NG tube.
+ *Investigations*:
  - FAST scan (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) – for intra‑abdominal bleeding.
  - Chest & pelvis X‑rays (quick screening).
  - Arterial blood gases, cross‑match, labs.
=== Secondary Survey
- Head‑to‑toe examination once patient is stabilized.
- Obtain AMPLE History
  - *A* – Allergies
  - *M* – Medications
  - *P* – Past medical history / Pregnancy
  - *L* – Last meal
  - *E* – Events / Environment leading to injury
- Palpate, auscultate, inspect all regions systematically.
=== Definitive Management
After complete evaluation → specific surgical interventions (operative repair, immobilization, debridement, etc.)

- Circulation and Resuscitation: Refer to @circulation-and-resuscitation
== Damage Control
=== Damage Control Resuscitation
Resuscitation philosophy used in major trauma before and during surgery.

*Goal*: Prevent the “lethal triad” (Hypothermia, Acidosis, Coagulopathy).
==== Key Principles
+ *Permissive hypotensionmaintain*: systolic BP ≈ 80–90 mmHg (until bleeding controlled).
+ *Hemostatic resuscitationearly*: balanced blood product transfusion (1:1:1) instead of large crystalloids.
+ *Minimize crystalloids*: avoid dilution of coagulation factors.
+ *Warm patient*: prevent hypothermia.
+ *Rapid recognition and correction of acidosis and coagulopathy.*

*In Short*: _Control of physiology before anatomy_

=== Damage Control Surgery
_A surgical strategy — not to complete definitive repair immediately, but to stop the bleeding, limit contamination, and shorten operative time, allowing physiologic stabilization in ICU first.
_

==== Phases
+ *Initial abbreviated surgery*
  - Quickly control hemorrhage (e.g., packing liver, clamping vessels, temporary closure).
  - Leave complex repairs for later.
+ *Intensive care resuscitation phase*
  - Correct coagulopathy, hypothermia, acidosis.
+ *Definitive surgery later (24–48 h)*
  - Once stable → perform definitive repair, reconstruction, or anastomosis.
In short: _Control anatomy once physiology recovered._
