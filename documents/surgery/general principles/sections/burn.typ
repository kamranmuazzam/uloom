= Burn
definition: A burn is an injury to body tissue caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, radiation, or friction, resulting in coagulative necrosis of the skin and underlying structures.

== Clinical Classification (by Depth)
#figure(table(
  columns: 4,
[Degree],[Tissue Involved],[Features],[Healing],
[1st‑degree (Superficial / Epidermal)],[Epidermis only],[Red, painful, dry, no blisters (like sunburn)],[Heals in 5–7 days, no scar],
[2nd‑degree (Partial thickness)],[Epidermis + variable dermis],[- Blisters present
- Very painful
- Base red or pale depending on depth],[Superficial dermal heals in 10–14 days; deep dermal may need grafting],
[3rd‑degree (Full thickness)],[Entire skin → may extend to subcutaneous tissue, muscle, bone],[- Painless (nerve endings destroyed)
- Dry, leathery, waxy or charred],[No spontaneous healing → grafting required],
),caption: [Classification of Burn])

_4th‑degree may involve muscle and bone charring_

== Rule of Nines(Wallace's Rule)
The surface area of the patient's hand(palmar surface) is equivalent to 1% of TBSA, hence this can be used to estimate percentage of burn
#figure(table(
  columns: 2,
[Region],[% TBSA],
[Head and neck],[9%],
[Each upper limb (entire arm)],[9% (Front 4.5 % + Back 4.5 %)],
[Each lower limb (entire leg)],[18% (Front 9 % + Back 9 %)],
[Anterior trunk],[18%],
[Posterior trunk],[18%],
[Perineum and genitalia],[1%],
[Total],[100%],
),caption: [Wallace's Rule of Nines])

_For children: head proportionally larger, legs smaller. so total head and neck is 18% and each infrex is 14%_
== Management
+ Primary Survey(cABCDE)
+ Secondary Survey
  + Detailed burn assessment using Rule of Nines (or Lund & Browder chart in children).
  + Document mechanism (flame, scald, electric, chemical).
  + Look for associated injuries (fractures, inhalation, trauma).
+ Fluid Resuscitation discussed in @fluid-resuscitation-in-burn
+ Other Measures
  - Pain relief (IV opioids preferred).
  - Tetanus prophylaxis.
  - Antibiotics: not routine initially — use only if infected.
  - Maintain warmth (avoid hypothermia!).
  - Catheterize bladder for monitoring if burn >20%.
+ Later Management
  - Wound care: cleansing, topical antimicrobials (silver sulfadiazine), sterile dressings.
  - Escharotomy for circumferential burns.
  - Debridement and grafting after resuscitation (48–72 hr).
== Fluid Resuscitation <fluid-resuscitation-in-burn>
=== Indication
- Adults with >15% TBSA burns
- Children with >10% TBSA burns
=== Parkland Formula (4‑2‑1 rule)
#align(center)[4 mL × body weight (kg) × %TBSA burnt = total fluid in 24 h.]
- Use Ringer’s lactate typically.
*Distribution*
- ½ in first 8 hours (from time of burn, not time of arrival!)
- ½ in next 16 hours.

_First half is given through both cannula, in next phase of 16 hours, 1st half of half from one cannula and 2nd half of half from next cannula_

*Monitor*: urine output (aim ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h), vitals, mental state.
