== Approach
=== History
#table(
  columns: 3,
[Aspect],[Points to Ask],[Diagnostic Clues],
[Onset & duration],[Gradual or sudden?],[Long-standing = benign; sudden = trauma/hernia/abscess],
[Progression],[Increasing in size or static?],[],
[Pain],[Constant or intermittent; relation to meals, posture],[Painful = inflammatory; painless = neoplastic],
[Reducibility / relation to strain],[Appears on cough, reduces on lying down],[Suggests hernia],
[Associated symptoms],[Nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary issues],[Hernia, intra-abdominal cause],
[Systemic symptoms],[Weight loss, fever],[Malignancy or infection],
[Past / family history],[Previous surgery, similar swellings],[Recurrent hernia, familial tumors],
)
=== Physical Examination
==== Inspection
- *Site* location gives major diagnostic clue (epigastric, umbilical, inguinal, etc.)
- *Size & shape*
- *Skin changes* redness, ulceration, pigmentation, veins
- *Movement with respiration* moves with liver or kidney?
- *Visible cough impulse*
- *Effect of tensing abdominal muscles (Fothergill’s test)*
  - If lump remains palpable = in abdominal wall (e.g., rectus sheath hematoma)
  - If disappears = intra‑abdominal.

==== Palpation
#figure(table(
[Feature],[Observation],[Interpretation],
[Temperature & Tenderness],[Local rise of temperature; tenderness on palpation],[Indicates active inflammation or infection (e.g., abscess, cellulitis). Absence → likely chronic or neoplastic lesion.],
[Consistency],[- Soft: easily compressible
- Cystic: fluctuant, fluid‑filled
- Firm: rubbery resistance],
[- Hard: stony resistance],[- Soft: Lipoma, cyst, hernia
- Cystic: Abscess, sebaceous cyst
- Firm: Fibroma, enlarged lymph node
- Hard: Malignant tumor, calcified lesion, bone involvement],
[Margins & Surface],[Smooth, well‑defined vs irregular, poorly defined],[- Smooth/defined: Benign, encapsulated
- Irregular/ill‑defined: Malignant or infiltrative],
[Fluctuation],[Positive fluctuation test (compress one side, bulge felt opposite)],[Presence of fluid or semi-fluid content inside swelling (e.g., abscess, cyst).],
[Pulsatility],[- Expansile: swelling expands in all directions with each pulse],
[- Transmitted: only moves up/down with pulse],[- Expansile pulsation: Aneurysm (vascular origin).
- Transmitted pulsation: Overlying mass resting on artery (e.g., lymph node over carotid).],
[Cough impulse],[Expansion or visible impulse on coughing],[Indicates communication with abdominal cavity → typical of hernia or expansile respiratory origin.],
[Reducibility],[Swelling decreases/disappears on pressure or lying down],[Suggests hernia or varicocele (condition with a neck communicating to cavity and allowing content to return).],
[Relation to muscle contraction / deep structures],[- Lump becomes less prominent or fixed when muscle tensed (Fothergill’s test)],[- Moves with muscle: within muscle
- Fixed on tensing: in muscle
- Disappears on tensing: beneath muscle/intra‑abdominal
- Fixed to skin or deep tissue: invasive or malignant lesion.],

==== Percussion
Dullness (solid) vs resonant (contains air, e.g., bowel).
==== Auscultation
- Bruit → vascular lesion (e.g., aneurysm).
- Bowel sounds → gut‑related swelling.
==== Special Tests
- Slipping Sign : Lipoma
- Indentation Test : Sebaceous Cyst
- Compressibility : Hemangioma
==== Systemic Examination
- Examine Regional Lymph nodes
- Palpate abdomen for secondaries or organomegaly.
- Check other body systems depending on suspicion.
