== Approach
=== History
#table(
  columns: 3,
  [Aspect],[Points to Ask],[Diagnostic Clues],
  [Onset & duration],[Gradual or sudden?],[Long-standing = benign; sudden = trauma/hernia/abscess],
  [Progression],[Increasing in size or static?],[Rapid increase → inflammation or malignancy],
  [Pain],[Constant/intermittent; relation to meals or posture],[Painful = inflammatory; painless = benign or malignant tumor],
  [Reducibility / strain relation],[Appears on cough, reduces on lying down],[Suggests hernia],
  [Associated symptoms],[Nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary issues],[Suggests hernia or intra-abdominal pathology],

  [Past / family history],[Previous surgery, similar lumps in relatives],[Recurrent hernia, familial tumors],
)

=== Physical Examination

==== Inspection
- *Site* — anatomical region suggests likely diagnosis.
- *Size, shape, color, surface, and edge.*
- *Skin changes* — redness, ulceration, pigmentation, scars, veins, punctum.
- *Movement with respiration* — suggests hepatic/kidney masses.
- *Visible pulsations or cough impulse.*
- *Effect of tensing muscles (Fothergill’s test)* — defines intra- vs extramuscular lumps.

==== Palpation

  [Feature],[Observation],[Interpretation],
  [Temperature & tenderness],[Local rise of temperature; tenderness],[Inflammatory],
  [Consistency],[Soft, firm, hard, cystic],[Soft = lipoma/hernia; Hard = malignancy],
  [Margins & surface],[Well/ill-defined, smooth/irregular],[Ill-defined = invasive],

),caption:[Findings on Palpation])

==== Percussion
- *Dull* → solid lesion  
- *Resonant* → air-containing hernia or hollow viscus involvement

==== Auscultation
- *Bruit* → vascular swelling (aneurysm/hemangioma)  
- *Bowel sounds* → hernia containing bowel

==== Special Tests
- *Slipping sign* → Lipoma  
- *Indentation test* → Sebaceous cyst  
- *Compressibility* → Hemangioma  
- *Transillumination* → Cystic swelling  
- *Expansile cough impulse* → Hernia

==== Systemic & Regional Examination
- Examine *draining lymph nodes*  
- Abdominal palpation for *organomegaly or secondaries*  
- *Skeletal or joint relation* if near bone

=== Differential Diagnosis by Consistency
#table(
  columns: 2,
  [Consistency],[Common Causes],
  [Soft],[Lipoma, hernia, cyst, varicocele],
  [Firm],[Lymph node, fibroma, neuroma],
  [Cystic],[Sebaceous cyst, abscess, dermoid, ganglion],
  [Hard],[Carcinoma, calcified mass, bony involvement],
)

=== Basic Investigations
- *Ultrasound:* first-line for most swellings  
- *Doppler study:* vascularity, thrombosis  
- *X-ray:* calcification, bony origin  
- *CT/MRI:* deep extent, tissue planes  
- *FNAC / core biopsy:* diagnosis confirmation  
- *Blood tests:* inflammatory/tumor markers
#info_box([#shomiron],[
- FNAC : Cells taken
- Core biopsy : Tissue taken
Which one better : Core biopsy as tissue taken

If there is confusion, Clinically malignant, FNAC says benign
])
=== Principles of Management
- Identify *cause, extent, relations*  
- *Control infection* before surgery  
- *Excision or drainage* as indicated  
- *Histopathology* mandatory for diagnosis  
- *Follow-up* for recurrence or malignant change.

- trunk
- forearm.
=== Chance of Lipoma malignancy
#shomiron
- Back
- Retroperitoneal
- Femoral triangle
=== Complications
#shomiron
+ Calcification

- Spindle-cell lipoma
- Intramuscular lipoma.
=== Clinical features
  - Soft, lobulated, mobile swelling beneath skin.
  - Painless, slow-growing.
  - *Slipping sign* positive — mass slips from beneath examining fingers.
=== Investigations
  - Ultrasound - hyperechoic lesion.

Excision and Biopsy

== Sebaceous Cyst <sebaceous-cyst>

== Dermoid Cyst <dermoid-cyst>

- *Definition*: Benign cystic lesion lined by stratified squamous epithelium containing dermal appendages (hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands).

- *Treatment*:
  - Complete surgical excision with capsule intact.
  - Ensure no communication with deeper structures or intracranial cavity (especially midline cranial dermoids).
