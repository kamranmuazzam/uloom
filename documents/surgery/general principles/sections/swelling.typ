=== Physical Examination

==== Inspection
- *Site* — anatomical region suggests likely diagnosis.
- *Size, shape, color, surface, and edge.*
- *Skin changes* — redness, ulceration, pigmentation, scars, veins, punctum.
- *Movement with respiration* — suggests hepatic/kidney masses.
- *Visible pulsations or cough impulse.*
- *Effect of tensing muscles (Fothergill’s test)* — defines intra- vs extramuscular lumps.

==== Palpation

),caption:[Findings on Palpation])

==== Percussion
- *Dull* → solid lesion  
- *Resonant* → air-containing hernia or hollow viscus involvement

==== Auscultation
- *Bruit* → vascular swelling (aneurysm/hemangioma)  
- *Bowel sounds* → hernia containing bowel

==== Special Tests
- *Slipping sign* → Lipoma  
- *Indentation test* → Sebaceous cyst  
- *Compressibility* → Hemangioma  
- *Transillumination* → Cystic swelling  
- *Expansile cough impulse* → Hernia

==== Systemic & Regional Examination
- Examine *draining lymph nodes*  
- Abdominal palpation for *organomegaly or secondaries*  
- *Skeletal or joint relation* if near bone

=== Differential Diagnosis by Consistency
#table(
  columns: 2,
  [Consistency],[Common Causes],
  [Soft],[Lipoma, hernia, cyst, varicocele],
  [Firm],[Lymph node, fibroma, neuroma],
  [Cystic],[Sebaceous cyst, abscess, dermoid, ganglion],
  [Hard],[Carcinoma, calcified mass, bony involvement],
)

=== Basic Investigations
- *Ultrasound:* first-line for most swellings  
- *Doppler study:* vascularity, thrombosis  
- *X‑ray:* calcification, bony origin  
- *CT/MRI:* deep extent, tissue planes  
- *FNAC / core biopsy:* diagnosis confirmation  
- *Blood tests:* inflammatory/tumor markers

=== Principles of Management
- Identify *cause, extent, relations*  
- *Control infection* before surgery  
- *Excision or drainage* as indicated  
- *Histopathology* mandatory for diagnosis  
- *Follow‑up* for recurrence or malignant change.

== Lipoma
- *Definition*: Benign tumor of mature adipose tissue in subcutaneous plane.
- *Common sites*: Back, shoulder, neck, trunk, forearm.
- *Variants*: Angiolipoma, spindle-cell lipoma, intramuscular lipoma.
- *Clinical features*:
  - Soft, lobulated, mobile swelling beneath skin.
  - Painless, slow-growing.
  - *Slipping sign* positive — mass slips from beneath examining fingers.
- *Investigations*:
  - Ultrasound – hyperechoic lesion.
  - MRI – homogenous fat signal intensity.
  - FNAC/core biopsy if atypical.
- *Histopathology*: Mature adipocytes with fibrous capsule; absence of mitosis or atypia.
- *Complications*: Pressure symptoms, pain if compressed, rare liposarcomatous change.
- *Treatment*: Simple excision; ensure complete removal to avoid recurrence.

== Sebaceous Cyst <sebaceous-cyst>

- *Definition*: Retention cyst of the sebaceous gland due to obstruction of its duct; lined by stratified squamous epithelium and filled with keratinous material.
- *Synonyms*: Epidermoid cyst, epidermal inclusion cyst.
- *Common sites*: Scalp, face, neck, back, scrotum.
- *Etiology*:
  - Duct obstruction.
  - Post‑traumatic or congenital inclusion of epidermal elements.
- *Clinical features*:
  - Slow‑growing, round, subcutaneous swelling.
  - Freely mobile over deeper tissues but attached to skin.
  - *Punctum* present (blocked duct opening).
  - Contents cheesy, foul‑smelling when expressed.
  - No slipping sign (unlike lipoma).
- *Complications*:
  - Infection → abscess formation, rupture, and foul discharge.
  - Calcification or horn formation (sebaceous horn).
  - Rare malignant transformation (squamous cell carcinoma).
- *Differential diagnosis*: Lipoma, dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, abscess.
- *Investigations*: Mainly clinical; ultrasound if atypical.
- *Treatment*:
  - Elective complete surgical excision with intact capsule.
  - Avoid rupture during excision to prevent recurrence.
  - Incision and drainage if acutely infected → later excision after inflammation subsides.

== Dermoid Cyst <dermoid-cyst>

- *Definition*: Benign cystic lesion lined by stratified squamous epithelium containing dermal appendages (hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands).
- *Types*:
  - *Congenital (true)*: Due to sequestration of skin along lines of embryonic fusion.
  - *Acquired (implantation)*: Due to traumatic implantation of epithelium.
- *Common sites*:
  - Midline (external angular near outer angle of orbit), submental, suprasternal, postauricular, midline of scalp.
  - Ovarian and intracranial variants also occur.
- *Clinical features*:
  - Painless, slow‑growing, soft or firm, doughy swelling.
  - Not attached to skin or deep structures.
  - Usually no punctum.
  - No transillumination or cough impulse.
- *Complications*: Infection, rupture with foreign‑body granulomatous reaction.
- *Differential diagnosis*: Sebaceous cyst, lipoma, epidermoid cyst, lymph node.
- *Investigations*: Ultrasound or MRI if deep or midline (rule out intracranial extension in nasal/occipital dermoids).
- *Treatment*:
  - Complete surgical excision with capsule intact.
  - Ensure no communication with deeper structures or intracranial cavity (especially midline cranial dermoids).

== Hemangioma
- *Definition*: Benign vascular tumor composed of blood vessels.
- *Classification*:
  - By flow: Capillary (low flow), Cavernous (low flow), Arteriovenous (high flow).
  - By onset: Congenital vs Infantile (proliferative then involuting).
- *Common sites*: Skin, subcutaneous tissue, liver, oral cavity.
- *Clinical features*:
  - Soft, compressible, non-tender swelling with bluish discoloration.
  - *Compressibility* positive, *bruit* may be heard.
  - Enlarges on crying or straining.
- *Investigations*: Doppler USG (flow characteristics), MRI for extent and relation.
- *Complications*: Ulceration, bleeding, thrombosis, infection, high-output cardiac failure (hepatic/AV type).
- *Associations*: Kasabach–Merritt syndrome, PHACES syndrome.
- *Treatment*:
  - Observation for spontaneous involution (common in infants).
  - Sclerotherapy (sodium tetradecyl sulfate), laser ablation, embolization for large AVMs.
  - Surgical excision for residual fibrofatty tissue or complicated lesions.

== Hernia
- *Definition*: Protrusion of a viscus or its part through a defect in the wall of its containing cavity.
- *Predisposing factors*: Chronic cough, constipation, obesity, pregnancy, heavy lifting, collagen disorders.
- *Common types*: Inguinal (direct/indirect), femoral, umbilical, epigastric, incisional.
- *Special types*: Richter’s, Littre’s, Maydl’s, Spigelian, Obturator.
- *Anatomy highlights*:
  - Inguinal canal boundaries.
  - Myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud — reinforces mesh-based rationale.
- *Clinical features*:
  - Swelling with *cough impulse* and *reducibility*.
  - Expansile impulse on coughing.
  - Reducible → contents return.
  - Irreducible → cannot be reduced.
  - *Obstructed* → pain, vomiting, distension.
  - *Strangulated* → severe continuous pain, tenderness, systemic signs.
- *Special tests* (inguinal): Invagination test, occlusion test, deep ring occlusion test.
- *Investigations*: Primarily clinical; ultrasound or CT for uncertain/special cases.
- *Complications*: Obstruction, strangulation, recurrence, testicular atrophy, chronic groin pain.
- *Treatment*:
  - *Elective*: Herniorrhaphy (tissue repair) or hernioplasty (mesh repair, e.g. Lichtenstein).
  - *Laparoscopic*: TAPP (transabdominal preperitoneal), TEP (totally extraperitoneal).
  - *Emergency*: Strangulated hernia → urgent exploration and repair.
