= Investigation and Diagnosis

== General Approach
- Detailed *history* and *physical examination* remain the cornerstones.
- Distinguish between *emergency* and *elective* cases.
- Identify *red flag symptoms* requiring urgent evaluation (e.g. bleeding, sepsis, ischemia).
- Adopt a *systematic and stepwise* approach — from noninvasive to invasive tests.
- Utilize *diagnostic algorithms* or protocols where available.

== Laboratory Investigations
- *Baseline tests:*
  - Complete blood count (CBC)
  - Renal function tests (Urea, Creatinine, Electrolytes)
  - Liver function tests (LFTs)
  - Blood sugar profile
  - Coagulation profile (PT/INR, aPTT)
  - Cross-matching and grouping when surgery is likely
- *Special tests:* as indicated (e.g. amylase/lipase, tumor markers, CRP, ESR)
- *Point-of-care testing (POCT):* bedside glucose, ABG, and lactate in acute care.
- *Microbiological studies:* cultures, sensitivity, and serology where infection is suspected.
- Consider *molecular and genetic tests* in oncology and specific syndromic conditions.

== Imaging
- *Plain radiography:* Chest, Abdomen (erect/supine views).
- *Ultrasonography:* First-line for soft-tissue and abdominal pathology.
- *CT and MRI:* For complex or deep pathology, staging, or preoperative planning.
- *Contrast studies:* Barium, IVU, angiography — as indicated.
- *Nuclear imaging:* For functional assessment (e.g. thyroid, renal, bone scans).
- *Image-guided interventions:* diagnostic aspiration, drainage, or biopsy.
- Practice *imaging safety*: avoid unnecessary radiation, check for contrast allergy and nephrotoxicity (ALARA principle).

== Endoscopic and Specialized Diagnostic Procedures
- Gastroscopy, Colonoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Cystoscopy, Laparoscopy.
- Allow for *biopsy* and direct visualization.
- Ensure *informed consent* and appropriate *pre-procedure preparation*.

== Functional and Physiological Assessments
- Pulmonary and cardiac assessment in preoperative evaluation.
- Nutritional assessment (BMI, serum albumin, anthropometry).
- Endocrine evaluation where relevant (thyroid, adrenal, diabetic control).

== Tissue Diagnosis
- *Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)*
- *Core or Tru-Cut biopsy*
- *Excision biopsy*
- *Frozen section* for intraoperative decision-making.
- *Immunohistochemistry* and *molecular profiling* as adjuncts in oncology.

== Diagnostic Principles
- Establish *working* and *differential* diagnoses.
- Correlate *clinical*, *laboratory*, and *imaging* findings.
- Confirm diagnosis before *definitive management*.
- Apply *evidence-based* and *cost-effective* investigation strategy.
- Reassess and repeat evaluation where *diagnostic uncertainty* remains.
- Engage *multidisciplinary team (MDT)* when complex or systemic disease is suspected.
- Document findings clearly and communicate results effectively.

== Preoperative Evaluation
- Assessment of co-morbidities (cardiac, respiratory, renal, endocrine).
- ASA grading for surgical risk.
- Optimization before elective procedures.
- Age- and risk-specific screening investigations (e.g. ECG, chest X-ray, renal function).

== Special Considerations
- *Acute abdomen:* Immediate basic labs + imaging (US/CT) as guided by presentation.
- *Oncology:* Emphasize staging work-up (TNM), biopsy confirmation, molecular markers.
- *Trauma:* Follow ATLS principles — FAST scan, radiographs, CT if stable.
- *Sepsis workup:* Source identification, blood cultures before antibiotics.
- *Pre-anesthetic evaluation:* airway assessment, ASA classification, optimization of chronic illnesses.
- *Perioperative risk stratification:* cardiac risk indices, functional capacity.

== Documentation and Follow-up
- Maintain accurate *clinical records* and investigation results.
- Review results promptly, act on *critical findings*.
- Communicate with the team and patient; integrate findings into the management plan.
