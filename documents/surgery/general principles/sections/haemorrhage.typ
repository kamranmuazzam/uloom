*Definition*#shomiron #written:Extravasation of Blood#footnote[don't mention blood vessel#shomiron] is called Haemorrhage
== Classification
Following are various ways to classify haemorrhage.#shomiron #card #written
=== Clinical Classification
- *Primary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding during surgery or trauma.
- *Reactionary Haemorrhage*
  - Within 24 hours after surgery#footnote[in ENT this is within 7-14#footnote[before 7 days and after 24 hours is classified as primary haemorrhage#shomiron] days, basically within the time vascular repair occurs].
- *Secondary Haemorrhage*
  - Bleeding occurs after 7-14 days of surgery#footnote[in ENT this is after 7-14 days, basically after the time vascular repair occurs].

=== Reactionary Haemorrhage <reactionary-haemorrhage>

*Cause of Reactionary Haemorrhage*#shomiron

After reversal of anesthesia, pressure increase and the following causes might cause haemorrhage #shomiron #written
- Slipping of ligature
- Dislodgement of clot

Reactionary Haemorrhage happens in operations where vascularity, collateral circulation is more

=== Secondary Haemorrhage
The main cause of Secondary haemorrhage is infection, which causes sloughing out of the blood vessel wall.

_Sentinel or warning hemorrhage — small episode of bleeding before catastrophic secondary hemorrhage (clinically significant in carotid blowout, pseudoaneurysm, etc.)_

=== According to Visibility
==== Concealed
Examples #written
 - Intracranial
 - Intrabdominal (Spleen, Liver.. More in Solid Organ)
 - Closed long bone fractures and pelvic fractures
==== Revealed
Examples #written
 - Accident
 - Trauma
 - Gum Bleeding
 - Epistaxis
 - Hematemesis
 - Hemoptysis
 - Melena
 - Menorrhagia
 - Gross Hematuria
 - Post Partum Hemorrhage
_Revealed haemorrhage is easier to diagnose but not necessarily easier to manage._
=== According to onset
==== Acute
Sudden, profuse (e.g., trauma, surgery).
==== Chronic
Slow, intermittent, often leading to iron-deficiency anemia (e.g., peptic ulcer, hemorrhoids, carcinoma).
=== Classification of Haemorrhagic Shock
As mentioned in @classification-of-haemorrhagic-shock
== Special Conditions of Haemorrhages
- Neonatal (Vitamin K deficiency)
- Obstetric (PPH)
- Post-fracture or burn patients (hidden losses)
- Due to coagulopathies (DIC, hemophilia, anticoagulant therapy)
== Haemorrhagic Disorders Related to Surgery
- DIC
- thrombocytopenia
- Vitamin K deficiency
- hepatic dysfunction
== Clinical Features of Haemorrhage <clinical-features-of-haemorrhage>
Clinical Features of Haemorrhage and Haemorrhagic Shock are as follows #written
- Oliguria → Anuria (late sign)
- General signs: pallor, cold clammy skin
- Cardiovascular: tachycardia#footnote[Weak Thready Pulse], hypotension
- Renal: oliguria → anuria (late sign)
- CNS: restlessness → Restlessness, Air hunger, Syncope
Narrow pulse pressure is an early sign.
_Postural BP changes in mild cases_
=== Local Effects
- Hematoma formation
- Compression of adjacent structures
- Risk of infection or gangrene (esp. if concealed haemorrhage within muscle compartments)
=== Investigations
Serial hematocrit/hemoglobin monitoring and Coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, INR) in surgical settings, as in pre-op.
=== Investigations in Suspected Internal Bleed
- CBC — ↓ Hb / Hct (after 24 hrs)
- Ultrasound (FAST scan) — to detect intraperitoneal fluid
- CT scan — especially for intracranial, splenic, hepatic bleeds
- Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) — if imaging unavailable
== Complications of Haemorrhage
- *Immediate*: Shock, Death.
- *Delayed*: Anemia, post-resorption Jaundice, Infection of Haematoma, calcification or organization of clot, ARDS, MOF(Multi-Organ Failure).
- *Post-transfusion complications*: If relevant to resuscitation.
== Effects of Haemorrhage on Circulation
Metabolic/Physiological responses to haemorrhage are as follows #written
- Peripheral vasoconstriction
- Tachycardia and increased cardiac output (initially)
- Venoconstriction, mobilisation of blood from reservoirs
- Activation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone and ADH pathways

*Based on Phases*
- Early phase: sympathetic activation → tachycardia, vasoconstriction → maintained BP.
- Late phase: compensatory failure → hypotension, metabolic acidosis
== Haemostasis
Spontaneous arrest of bleeding is called haemostasis#shomiron.

This requires some precondition, Platelelts. Also, platelets in the blood don't cause coagulation all the time without haemorrhage, because there are natural anticoagulants and vessel wall is normal.

=== Techniques of Haemostasis
The techniques of Haemorrhage are#card #written #shomiron
+ Pressure and Packing#footnote[using Gauze for 6-10 minites(clotting time)]
+ Elevation
+ Tourniquet (Esmarch Bandage)
+ Diathermy and Cauterization
+ Ligature (Large vessel)
+ Clipping (Laparoscopic Surgery)
+ Application of ultrasonic haemostatic device#footnote[New, Harmonic Scapel#shomiron, it vibrates 55k times per second. This causes heat coagulation., other newer devices are
- Bipolar vessel sealing device (LigaSure)
- Topical haemostatic agents — e.g., oxidized cellulose (Surgicel), fibrin glue, thrombin spray, gelatin sponge.
]
==== Surgical Hemostasis Principles
Basic Principles of Control of Haemorrhage is given as follows #written

_Always identify source of bleeding — arterial spurter, venous ooze, capillary oozing — before attempting control._
- Identify source before control
- Apply temporary pressure → definitive ligation
- Avoid excessive cauterization (can cause delayed hemorrhage)
- Correct coagulopathies and maintain normothermia
Techniques should be used as follows
- Temporary → pressure, clamp, tourniquet
- Definitive → ligation, suture, diathermy
- Physiological → vasospasm, platelet plug, clot formation
- Chemical → topical agents (thrombin, oxidized cellulose, etc.)

#info_box([
  *Tourniquet should be applied in the single bone.*#shomiron
],[
  For example, in case of bleeding from radial artery, Tourniquet should be applied to arm, not the forearm. This is because the pressure applied on the supposedly proximal part of radial artery will not occlude it because of it's communication in the interosseaus space. While pressure applied to the arm will directly reach the brachial artery.

== Circulation & Resuscitation <circulation-and-resuscitation>
Before moving to Circulation and Resuscitation, Trauma should be handled as per ATLS protocol in @atls
- Two large-bore (14–16 G) IV cannulae.
- Draw blood for cross-match, baseline investigations.
- Begin warm crystalloids (Ringer’s lactate or NS).
- If poor response → transfuse crossmatched or O-negative blood.
- Use Massive Transfusion Protocol if needed — 1:1:1 ratio of PRBC : FFP : Platelets.
- “Target urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr.”
- “Consider permissive hypotension until definitive haemostasis (except in head injury).”
- “Tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 g IV stat if within 3 hrs of trauma”
