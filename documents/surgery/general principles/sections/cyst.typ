= Cyst

*Definition*#written#shomiron: Abnormal collection of fluid within a sac which is lined by epithelium or endothelium
- True cyst is lined by epithelium
- False cyst (Pseudocyst) not lined by epithelium
== Classification
#card
- *Developmental cysts:* e.g. dermoid, branchial, thyroglossal.
- *Retention cysts:* due to obstruction of a duct, e.g. sebaceous, mucous.
- *Implantation cysts:* following trauma or surgery.
- *Parasitic cysts:* e.g. hydatid cyst.
- *Neoplastic cysts:* e.g. cystic degeneration in tumors.
- *Others:* e.g. ganglion, Baker’s cyst.

== General Features
- Slowly progressive, well-circumscribed swelling.
- May be fluctuant, transilluminant (depending on contents).
- Not pulsatile.
- Usually non-tender unless inflamed or infected.
- Contents may be serous, mucoid, sebaceous, or synovial.

== Common types

=== Sebaceous Cyst
_See Sebaceous Cyst in @sebaceous-cyst _  

=== Dermoid Cyst
_See Dermoid Cyst in @dermoid-cyst _

=== Implantation Cyst
- Results from implantation of epidermal cells into dermis following trauma or surgery.
- Common on palms, fingers, or scalp.  
- Lined by stratified squamous epithelium, contains keratin.

=== Mucous Cyst
- Retention cyst from minor salivary gland duct obstruction.
- Common on lower lip.
- Translucent bluish swelling; thin-walled; may rupture and recur.

=== Ganglion Cyst
- Mucin-filled cyst arising from a joint capsule or tendon sheath.
- Common on dorsum of wrist.
- May fluctuate in size and be mildly tender.
- Treated by aspiration, rupture, or excision.

=== Baker’s Cyst (Popliteal Cyst)
- Synovial cyst arising from posterior aspect of knee joint.
- Often associated with osteoarthritis or meniscal injury.
- May fluctuate with knee movement.
- Treatment: manage underlying joint pathology.

=== Branchial Cyst
- Developmental cyst due to persistence of branchial cleft.
- Classically in anterior triangle of neck, deep to SCM.
- Smooth, fluctuant, painless swelling.
- May be associated with branchial sinus or fistula.
- Treated by surgical excision.

=== Thyroglossal Cyst
- Midline cyst due to persistence of thyroglossal duct.
- Moves with deglutition and tongue protrusion.
- May become infected or form sinus.
- Treated by Sistrunk operation.

=== Hydatid Cyst
- Caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* infection.
- Commonly affects liver and lung.
- May rupture causing anaphylaxis.
- Managed by albendazole and surgical excision (PAIR technique).

== Principles of Treatment
- En bloc excision of cyst and its lining to prevent recurrence.
- Drainage only if infected (definitive excision deferred).
- Send specimen for histopathology to rule out neoplasm.
