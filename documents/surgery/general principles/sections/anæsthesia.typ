= Anæsthesia
definition: A reversible loss of sensation (with or without loss of consciousness), produced by specific drugs, allowing surgical and diagnostic procedures to be performed painlessly and safely.

    [1. Local Anaesthesia],[Temporary loss of sensation in a small, localized area by blocking nerve conduction at the site of administration.],[Infiltration with lignocaine, topical agents (lidocaine jelly, eutectic cream).],

- Caudal block],

      - IV: Propofol, thiopentone, ketamine
      - Inhalational: Isoflurane, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide],

== Components of General Anæsthesia
1. *Hypnosis* — loss of consciousness (IV / inhalational agents)
2. *Analgesia* — absence of pain perception
3. *Muscle relaxation* — paralysis for intubation and exposure
4. *Areflexia* — suppression of autonomic reflexes
5. *Amnesia* — no recall of events

== Pre‑Anaesthetic Assessment
- *Purpose*: Optimize patient condition and plan appropriate anaesthesia.
- *Steps*:
  + Detailed history (comorbidities, drug allergies, previous anaesthetic reactions)
  + Physical examination (airway, CVS, respiratory)
  + Necessary investigations: Hb, renal function, ECG, CXR if indicated.
  + ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) Physical Status Classification I–VI.

== Pre‑medication
Given 30–60 min before anaesthesia to relieve anxiety, decrease secretions, prevent aspiration, and stabilize haemodynamics.

== Stages of General Anæsthesia (Guedel’s Classification)
+ *Stage I*: Analgesia and conscious sedation.
+ *Stage II*: Excitement / delirium — risk of laryngospasm; minimized by rapid induction.
+ *Stage III*: Surgical anaesthesia — desired plane for surgery (further divided into planes I–IV).
+ *Stage IV*: Medullary paralysis — overdose; respiratory/cardiac arrest possible.

== Airway Management
*Goals*: Maintain airway patency and adequate ventilation.  
*Methods*: 
- Endotracheal intubation (definitive airway)
- Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)
- Oropharyngeal / nasopharyngeal airway
- Suctioning, positioning (chin lift, jaw thrust)
*Confirmation*: Bilateral chest movement, auscultation, capnography (ETCO₂).

== Monitoring during Anaesthesia
*Minimum monitoring standards*:
- Pulse oximetry (SaO₂)
- ECG
- Non‑invasive BP
- Capnography (ETCO₂)
- Temperature
- Urine output in major surgeries

== Complications of General Anæsthesia
=== During Induction
- *Airway obstruction:* Relaxation of tongue, poor head position
- *Aspiration:* Inadequate fasting or reflux
- *Hypotension / arrhythmia:* From induction agents

=== During Maintenance
- *Hypoxia / hypercarbia:* Inadequate ventilation
- *Awareness under GA:* Inadequate depth (< 1%)
- *Malignant hyperthermia:* Genetic, triggered by succinylcholine or volatile agents — ↑ETCO₂, rigidity, hyperthermia  
  → *Treatment:* Dantrolene IV, cooling, stop triggering agent
- *Anaphylaxis:* To muscle relaxant, antibiotics

=== During Recovery
- *Respiratory depression:* Delayed opioids or sedatives
- *Airway obstruction:* Tongue fall, retained secretions
- *Vomiting & aspiration:* Inadequate airway control
- *Shivering, hypothermia:* Loss of heat regulation
- *Sore throat, dental injury:* From intubation
- *Deep vein thrombosis / pulmonary embolism:* Due to immobility

=== Prevention & Management
- Pre‑oxygenation and airway protection
- Maintain normothermia, adequate fluid & electrolyte balance
- Continuous monitoring (SpO₂, BP, ECG, ETCO₂)
- Early mobilization, anti‑DVT prophylaxis (LMWH, compression stockings)
- Recovery under supervision — in Post‑Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU)

== Complications of Regional Anaesthesia
- Hypotension and bradycardia (sympathetic block)
- Post‑dural puncture headache
- Backache
- Urinary retention
- Nerve injury, infection, hematoma (rare)
- High spinal — respiratory and cardiovascular collapse

== Contraindications
=== To Spinal / Epidural
- Absolute: Patient refusal, infection at puncture site, coagulopathy, raised ICP, uncorrected hypovolemia
- Relative: Sepsis, spinal deformity, severe hypovolemia, cardiac lesions not tolerant to decreased preload

== Recovery & Post‑Anaesthetic Care
- Ensure airway reflexes return
- Monitor vital signs and urine output
- Manage pain, nausea, and temperature
- Discharge after Aldrete score ≥ 9

== High‑Yield Notes
- *Ketamine:* ↑BP, bronchodilator — useful in asthma, shock.
- *Propofol:* Rapid recovery, antiemetic, but causes hypotension.
- *Thiopentone:* Contraindicated in porphyria.
- *Etomidate:* Minimal CVS depression; useful in cardiomyopathy.
- *Succinylcholine:* Risk of hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia.
- *Local Anaesthetic Toxicity:* Circumoral numbness → seizures → cardiac arrest — treat with lipid emulsion (“Intralipid”).
