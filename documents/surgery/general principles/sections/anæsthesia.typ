= Anæsthesia
definition: A reversible loss of sensation (with or without loss of consciousness), produced by specific drugs, allowing surgical and diagnostic procedures to be performed painlessly and safely.

== Types

  columns: 3,
  [Type],[Definition / Mechanism],[Examples / Methods],
[1. Local Anaesthesia],[Temporary loss of sensation in a small, localized area by blocking nerve conduction at the site of administration.],[Infiltration with lignocaine, topical agents (lidocaine jelly, eutectic cream).],
[2. Regional Anaesthesia],[Blocks sensory (and often motor) function of a larger region by acting on major nerves or spinal cord roots.],[- Nerve block (brachial, pudendal, dental)
- Spinal anaesthesia (drug into CSF at L3–L4)
- Epidural anaesthesia (drug into epidural space)
- Caudal block],
[3. General Anaesthesia (GA)],[A reversible state of unconsciousness, with loss of sensation, pain, and muscle tone, produced by intravenous or inhalational agents.],[
  - IV: Propofol, thiopentone, ketamine
- Inhalational: Isoflurane, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide],
[4. Combined / Balanced Anaesthesia],[Combination of agents to achieve hypnosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation with minimal toxicity.],[E.g., GA + regional block],

== Stages of Anæsthesia
+ Stage I: Analgesia and conscious sedation.
+ Stage II: Excitement/delirium (risk of laryngospasm — minimized by rapid induction).
+ Stage III: Surgical anaesthesia (desired).
+ Stage IV: Medullary paralysis (dangerous, overdose).
== Common Complications of General Anæsthesia
+ *During Induction*
  - *Airway obstruction*:	Relaxation of tongue, poor positioning
  - *Aspiration*:	Inadequate fasting, regurgitation
  - *Hypotension / arrhythmia*:	From induction agents
+ *During Maintenance*
  - *Hypoxia / Hypercarbia*:	Inadequate ventilation
  - *Awareness under GA*:	Inadequate depth (< 1% but serious)
  - *Malignant hyperthermia*:	Rare, due to succinylcholine or volatile agents (genetic)
  - *Anaphylaxis*:	To muscle relaxant or antibiotic
+ *During Recovery / Post-op*
  - *Respiratory depression*:	Delayed effect of opioids, barbiturates
  - *Airway obstruction*:	Tongue fall, retained secretions
  - *Vomiting & aspiration*:	Incomplete airway control
  - *Shivering, hypothermia*:	Loss of thermostatic control
  - *Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) / pulmonary embolism*:	From immobility, surgical stress — common systemic complication
  - *Sore throat, dental injury*:	From intubation
=== Prevention & Management Principles
- Adequate pre‑oxygenation and airway protection.
- Careful monitoring (ECG, saturation, BP, end‑tidal CO₂).
- Maintain normothermia, fluid and electrolyte balance.
- Early mobilization and anti‑DVT prophylaxis (LMWH, compression stockings).
