== Importance in Surgery
- Prevents surgical site infection (SSI)
- Reduces hospital stay and morbidity
- Essential for safe operative technique

== Types of Asepsis
- *Medical Asepsis (Clean Technique)* — Procedures to reduce number and transfer of pathogens (e.g. hand hygiene, barrier precautions).
- *Surgical Asepsis (Sterile Technique)* — Procedures to eliminate all microorganisms from operative field (e.g. sterile gloves, gowning, draping).

== Sources of Infection
| Type | Examples |
|------|-----------|
| *Exogenous* | Air, instruments, operation theatre staff, surroundings |
| *Endogenous* | Patient’s own skin, GIT, respiratory or urinary flora |

  ),

)

== Indicators of Sterilization
- *Mechanical indicators:* Temperature and pressure recorders (gauges, autoclave logs).
- *Chemical indicators:* Color-change strips or autoclave tapes that react to set parameters.
- *Biological indicators:* Most reliable — spores used:
  + *Bacillus stearothermophilus* for steam sterilization
  + *Bacillus subtilis* for dry heat or ethylene oxide

== Disinfection
Disinfection eliminates most pathogenic organisms (not spores) from inanimate objects.

)

== Antiseptics
- Used on living tissues to inhibit or destroy microorganisms.
- Examples:
  + *Alcohols:* Rapid acting, poor residual effect.
  + *Chlorhexidine:* Persistent activity, good for pre-op hand scrub.
  + *Povidone-iodine:* Broad-spectrum, inactivated by organic matter.
  + *Cetrimide:* Quaternary ammonium compound, mild skin antiseptic.
  + *Hydrogen peroxide:* Cleans contaminated wounds (effervescence assists debris removal).

== Operation Theatre (OT) Asepsis
- *Zoning:* Divides OT into protective, clean, and sterile zones to reduce cross-contamination.
- *Air handling system:* Positive air pressure, 15-20 air changes/hour, HEPA filters, laminar flow in ultraclean theatres.
- *Cleaning protocol:* Surfaces wiped with approved disinfectants before and after every case.

== Pre-operative Preparation
=== Patient
- Bath the night before surgery.
- Hair removal by clipping (avoid razor shaving).
- Pre-operative skin preparation with antiseptic paint (povidone-iodine / chlorhexidine).
- Bowel or bladder preparation if necessary.

=== Surgeon and Team
- Surgical scrub for 3-5 min using antiseptic soap or alcoholic hand rub.
- Sterile gowning and gloving.
- Avoid jewelry and nail polish.

=== Instruments
- Sterilized according to material (autoclaving most common).
- Packaged with indicator tape and labeled with date.

== Infection Control and Waste Management
- *Hand hygiene:* Follow WHO “5 Moments for Hand Hygiene.”
- *Universal precautions:* Gloves, mask, gown, protective eyewear when dealing with blood or body fluids.
- *Waste segregation:* Bio-medical waste disposed as per color coding:  
  + Yellow — Infectious waste, body tissues  
  + Red — Contaminated plastics  
  + Blue/White — Glass and sharps (in puncture-proof container)  
  + Black — General non-infectious waste  
- *Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):* For accidental blood exposure, follow HIV and HBV protocols.

== Storage and Maintenance of Sterile Articles
- Store packs in clean, dry, dust-free environment.
- Avoid moisture contamination.
- Label with sterilization date; *event-related sterility* preferred over time-based.

== High-Yield Notes
- Autoclave is the *gold standard* for sterilization of surgical instruments.
- *Glutaraldehyde 2% (Cidex)* — for delicate instruments; requires 10 hr immersion for true sterilization.
- *Ethylene oxide gas (EO)* — for heat- and moisture-sensitive items (e.g. plastics, catheters); ensure proper aeration to remove toxic residues.
- *Biological indicator* most reliable in verifying autoclave efficiency.
- *Alcohol hand rubs* ineffective against spores; wash with soap and water in suspected *Clostridium difficile* contamination.
- *Povidone-iodine* is inactivated by blood or organic material — always clean before applying.
- *Surgical masks* prevent droplet spread, not airborne pathogens — HEPA or N95 needed for airborne precautions.
