== Neoplasm
definition: A neoplasm (tumor) is an abnormal autonomous proliferation of cells that continues to grow even after cessation of the initiating stimulus.

== Difference Between Benign and Malignant Tumors

  [Feature],[Benign],[Malignant],
[Growth rate],[Slow],[Rapid],
[Growth pattern],[Expansive, well circumscribed, encapsulated],[Infiltrative, invasive, poorly defined margins],
[Differentiation],[Well‑differentiated, resembles tissue of origin],[Poorly differentiated (anaplastic)],

== Principles of Managemnet of Malignant Tumor
+ Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MDT)
  - Team approach with oncologic surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, pathologist, radiologist, and palliative specialist.
+ Diagnosis and Staging
- Histological confirmation (biopsy/FNAC) is mandatory before definitive therapy.
- Grading: degree of cellular differentiation.
- Staging (TNM system):
  - T — Primary tumor size/invasion
  - N — Lymph node involvement
  - M — Distant metastasis
Treatment Modalities — often combined:

[Phase],[Purpose],[Modalities],
[Neoadjuvant therapy],[Shrink tumor before surgery],[Chemotherapy / Radiotherapy],
[Surgery],[Mainstay for solid tumors],[Wide local excision, removal of primary + regional LNs],
[Adjuvant therapy],[Destroy microscopic residual disease],[Post‑op chemo/radio],
[Definitive non‑surgical therapy],[For unresectable or sensitive tumors],[Radiotherapy or chemoradiation],
[Targeted / Immunotherapy],[Specific molecular targets or immune modulators],[Trastuzumab, checkpoint inhibitors],
),caption: [Treatment Modalities for Malignancy])

4. Monitoring and Follow-Up
  - Regular clinical exams, imaging, tumor markers to detect recurrence early.
+ Palliative (Supportive) Care
  - For advanced disease: pain control, symptom management, psychological support, hospice care.
