= Oncology

== Neoplasm
*Definition*: A neoplasm (tumor) is an abnormal autonomous proliferation of cells that continues to grow even after cessation of the initiating stimulus.

== Etiology and Risk Factors
- Chemical carcinogens: polycyclic hydrocarbons, aflatoxin, nitrosamines  
- Physical agents: radiation, chronic irritation  
- Biological factors: oncogenic viruses (EBV, HPV, HBV, HCV), bacteria (H. pylori)  
- Genetic predisposition, immunodeficiency, and hormonal influences

== Carcinogenesis
- Multistep process: initiation → promotion → progression  
- Genetic basis involving:
  + Activation of proto‑oncogenes (e.g., RAS)
  + Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, RB)
  + Defects in DNA repair mechanisms  
  + Evasion of apoptosis, limitless replication, angiogenesis

== Difference Between Benign and Malignant Tumors

  [Example],[Fibroma, lipoma, adenoma],[Carcinoma, sarcoma],
), caption: [Difference between Benign and Malignant Tumors])

== Routes of Spread of Malignant Tumor 
#written #viva
+ *Local Infiltration* – Direct extension into surrounding tissues.  
   Example: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of oral cavity → adjacent structures.  
+ *Lymphatic Spread* – Common in carcinomas.  
   Example: Breast carcinoma → axillary lymph nodes.  
+ *Hematogenous Spread* – Common in sarcomas.  
   Example: Osteosarcoma → lungs; Hepatocellular carcinoma → bone/lungs.  
+ *Transcoelomic (seeding)* – Spread across serous cavities.  
   Example: Ovarian carcinoma → peritoneum.  
+ *Perineural/CSF spread* – Example: Brain tumor → along nerve roots.  

== Tumor Markers
#figure(table(
  columns:3,
  [Marker],[Associated Tumor],[Utility],
  [AFP],[Hepatocellular carcinoma, germ cell tumors],[Diagnosis, follow‑up],
  [CEA],[Colorectal, pancreatic, gastric cancers],[Monitoring, prognosis],
  [CA‑125],[Ovarian carcinoma],[Response assessment],
  [PSA],[Prostate carcinoma],[Screening and surveillance],
  [β‑hCG],[Choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors],[Diagnosis, follow‑up],
), caption: [Common Tumor Markers])

== Paraneoplastic Syndromes
- *Endocrine*: Cushing’s (ACTH), hypercalcemia (PTHrP)  
- *Neurologic*: cerebellar degeneration  
- *Hematologic*: migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau sign)  
- *Dermatologic*: acanthosis nigricans

])

== Principles of Management of Malignant Tumor
+ *Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MDT)*
  - Team approach involving surgeon, medical/radiation oncologists, pathologist, radiologist, and palliative specialist.
=== Members of MTB 
#written #viva
+ Surgeon  
+ Oncologist (Medical/Clinical)  
+ Radiotherapist  
+ Histopathologist  
+ Radiologist  
+ Psychologist  
+ Specialized Nurse (Colostomy nurse, breast nurse as needed)  
+ *Diagnosis and Staging*
  - Histological confirmation (biopsy/FNAC) is mandatory before definitive therapy.  
  - *Grading:* degree of cellular differentiation.  
  - *Staging (TNM system):*
    - T — Primary tumor size/invasion  
    - N — Lymph node involvement  
    - M — Distant metastasis  
== Counseling 
#written #viva
- Always counsel the patient *in presence of a legal guardian* (not spouse only).  
- Spouse should also be informed to understand possible complications and prognosis.  
- Discuss diagnosis, treatment options, side effects, prognosis, and financial aspects clearly.  
- Obtain informed consent before initiation of therapy.  
+ *Treatment Modalities* — often combined:
#figure(table(
  columns: 3,
  [Phase],[Purpose],[Modalities],
  [Neoadjuvant therapy],[Shrink tumor before surgery],[Chemotherapy / Radiotherapy],
  [Surgery],[Mainstay for solid tumors],[Wide local excision, removal of primary + regional LNs, adequate margins],
  [Adjuvant therapy],[Destroy microscopic residual disease],[Post‑op chemo/radio],
  [Definitive non‑surgical therapy],[For unresectable or sensitive tumors],[Radiotherapy or chemoradiation],
  [Targeted / Immunotherapy],[Specific molecular targets or immune modulators],[Trastuzumab, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR‑T therapy],
), caption: [Treatment Modalities for Malignancy])

+ *Performance and Resectability Assessment*
  - ECOG / Karnofsky performance status; cardiopulmonary and nutritional evaluation.

+ *Monitoring and Follow‑Up*
  - Regular clinical exam, imaging, tumor markers to detect recurrence early.

+ *Palliative (Supportive) Care*
  - Pain control, symptom management, psychological support, hospice care.

== Complications of Cancer Therapy
- *Surgical:* bleeding, infection, lymphoedema  
- *Chemotherapy:* myelosuppression, mucositis, alopecia  
- *Radiotherapy:* skin fibrosis, radiation enteritis, secondary malignancy  

== Emerging and Future Directions
- Precision oncology, liquid biopsy, immunogenomics, and personalized cancer vaccines.

== Cancer Screening 
#written
Early detection reduces mortality through routine screening tests.

)

== Follow-up 
#written #viva
- *Breast carcinoma:* lifelong follow-up.  
  - Every 3 months for first 2 years, every 6 months for next 3 years, then annually.  
  - Investigations: clinical exam, mammography/USG, tumor markers.  
- Educate about self-examination and recurrence symptoms.
