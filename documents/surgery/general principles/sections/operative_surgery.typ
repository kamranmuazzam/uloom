== Supplementary General Surgical Knowledge (High-Yield)

=== Surgical Instruments
- Named classification: cutting, grasping, retracting, hemostatic.
- Examples: scalpel, forceps, needle holders, artery forceps.

=== Suture Materials & Techniques
- Absorbable (catgut, vicryl) vs non-absorbable (silk, nylon).
- Patterns: interrupted, continuous, mattress, subcuticular.

=== Sterilization & Disinfection
- Autoclaving (121°C, 15 psi, 15-30 min).
- Chemical sterilants for heat-sensitive instruments.

=== Operation Theatre (OT) Design
- Zoning: outer → clean → sterile area.
- Laminar airflow, positive pressure ventilation.

== Laparoscopic Surgery
#written #card

*Definition*:#written #card
Laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery is a technique that allows surgical operations through small incisions using a camera (laparoscope) and specialized instruments.

=== Advantages of Laparoscopic Surgery
#written #card
- Minimally invasive approach.  
- Small incisions and minimal scarring.  
- Less postoperative pain.  
- Better cosmetic outcome.  
- Reduced blood loss.  
- Early ambulation and recovery.  
- Decreased hospital stay and faster return to work.  

=== Disadvantages of Laparoscopic Surgery
#written #card
- Expensive equipment and maintenance.  
- Lack of tactile (touch) sensation.  
- Two-dimensional view (limited depth perception).  
- Steep learning curve.  
- Risk of CO₂ insufflation-related complications.

=== Minimal Access Surgery
*Definition*: It is a group of surgical procedures performed through small portals using endoscopic visualization (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, arthroscopy).

=== Advantages and Examples 
#written
- Less pain, minimal scarring, early recovery.  
- *Renal System Procedures:*
  - Kidney: Laparoscopic nephrectomy.  
  - Ureter: Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.  
  - Bladder: Laparoscopic cystolithotomy.  
  - Prostate: Laparoscopic prostatectomy.  

= Incision, Excision & Closure

== Incision
*Definition*#shomiron: Breach of continuity of skin or mucous membrane by a sharp knife for surgical means is called incision.

=== Principles of a Good Incision
- Provides adequate exposure of operative field  
- Causes minimal tissue trauma and bleeding  
- Follows Langer’s lines to reduce tension and scarring  
- Avoids vital structures (nerves, vessels)  
- Should allow easy closure and good cosmetic outcome  
- Must be made under aseptic precautions

=== Common Surgical Incisions
- Midline (vertical): rapid entry, minimal vascular damage  
- Paramedian: stronger wound, but slower entry  
- Transverse / Muscle-splitting: less postoperative pain, better cosmesis  
- Oblique or Curvilinear: e.g., Kocher’s, Lanz, or McBurney’s incision  
- Specialized incisions based on anatomical region and exposure needed

=== Complications of Poor Incision
- Excessive bleeding  
- Necrosis of wound edges  
- Poor exposure → technical difficulty  
- Wound dehiscence or infection  
- Unsatisfactory scar/cosmesis
=== Upper Midline Incision

== Excision
*Definition*#shomiron: Removal of an organ or portion of an organ from the body

=== Types of Excision
- Total excision — complete removal (e.g., cyst or tumor)  
- Partial/wedge excision — removal of part of an organ  
- Radical excision — includes main lesion and nearby tissues (possibly with lymph nodes)

=== Principles of Excision
- Plan incision/excision lines to ensure adequate margins  
- Preserve vital structures whenever possible  
- Gentle handling of tissues  
- Control bleeding meticulously  
- Always send specimen for histopathological examination

== Closure
#info_box([Wound Closure#shomiron],[
- *Primary Closure*: during surgery  
- *Delayed Primary Closure*: within 24-48 h of injury  
- *Secondary Closure*: after 48 h, post-infection control
])

=== Principles of Wound Closure
- Gentle handling of tissues  
- Eliminate dead space  
- Accurate approximation of tissue layers  
- Maintain asepsis  
- Ensure hemostasis  
- Provide adequate drainage as required

=== Methods of Closure
- Sutures (absorbable / non-absorbable)  
- Staples or clips  
- Adhesive tapes or tissue glue  
- Combination methods as per wound site and tension

#info_box([Methods of Secondary Closure#shomiron],[
- Secondary suture — when wound margins are close  
- Skin graft — when wound margins are far apart  
- Myocutaneous flap — for exposed bone (e.g., ankle)
])

#info_box([Skin Graft#shomiron],[
*Split/Partial Thickness*  
- Includes epidermis and part of dermis  

*Full Thickness*  
- Both epidermis and dermis (used for sole, palm)  
- Usually harvested from groin or neck
])


== Principles of Operative Exposure #high_yeild
1. Incision must provide *adequate exposure*.  
2. Should follow *anatomical planes* to reduce bleeding.  
3. Allow *extension* if required.  
4. Minimize *damage to muscle and nerves*.  
5. Ensure *proper closure* to prevent complications.

== Additional High-Yield Points
- *Local factors affecting healing*: infection, ischemia, tension, foreign body  
- *Systemic factors*: diabetes, malnutrition, steroid therapy, anemia  
- *Complications*: wound dehiscence, keloid/hypertrophic scar, infection, delayed healing
