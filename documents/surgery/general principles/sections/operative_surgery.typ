[Monitoring for complications],[Fever, vomiting, urine output, bowel sounds],
[Mobilization],[Early ambulation to prevent DVT, pneumonia],
[Diet],[Gradual resumption once peristalsis returns],

== Laparoscopic Surgery #written #card

=== Definition #written #card
Laparoscopic or minimally invasive surgery is a technique that allows surgical operations through small incisions using a camera (laparoscope) and specialized instruments.

=== Advantages of Laparoscopic Surgery #written #card
- Minimally invasive approach.  
- Small incisions and minimal scarring.  
- Less postoperative pain.  
- Better cosmetic outcome.  
- Reduced blood loss.  
- Early ambulation and recovery.  
- Decreased hospital stay and faster return to work.  

=== Disadvantages of Laparoscopic Surgery #written #card
- Expensive equipment and maintenance.  
- Lack of tactile (touch) sensation.  
- Two-dimensional view (limited depth perception).  
- Steep learning curve.  
- Risk of CO₂ insufflation-related complications.

=== Definition of Minimal Access Surgery #written #card
It is a group of surgical procedures performed through small portals using endoscopic visualization (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, arthroscopy).

=== Advantages and Examples #written
- Less pain, minimal scarring, early recovery.  
- *Renal System Procedures:*
  - Kidney: Laparoscopic nephrectomy.  
  - Ureter: Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.  
  - Bladder: Laparoscopic cystolithotomy.  
  - Prostate: Laparoscopic prostatectomy.
