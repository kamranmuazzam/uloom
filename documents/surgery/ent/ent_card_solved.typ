- Barium swallow (irregular narrowing)
- endoscopy with biopsy
- CT chest for staging.  
=== Treatment
- Early: Esophagectomy ± gastric pull-up.  
- Palliative stenting or radiotherapy for advanced cases.
== Achalasia Cardia
=== Etiology
degeneration of nerves in the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to a failure to relax
=== Clinical Feature
- Dysphagia for solids + liquids
- Regurgitation
- Retrosternal fullness
- Weight loss.  
=== Treatment
- Balloon dilatation
- Heller's myotomy
- Botulinum toxin injection.

  - bulbar palsy.  
+ *Esophageal*
  - stricture
