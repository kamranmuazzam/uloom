== Gall Stone
=== Pathogenesis of Stone Formation
Causes
+ Metabolic Theory
+ Infective Theory
+ Stasis

==== Metabolic Theory
- The composition of bile is cholesterol:bile salt = 1:20
- If this composition is altererd, i-e 20:1, then extra cholesterol gets deposited in gall bladder and leads to cholesterol stone formation.
 - This bile is called supersatured bile

Risk Factors
- Female
- Forty
- Fair
- Fertile
- Flatulence
- Fatty

==== Infective Theory
- Salmonella typhi
- Salmonella paratyphi
- Clonorchis sinesis
- E. coli

=== Stasis
- During Fasting
- Decreased contraction of gall bladder as no release of gall bladder as no release of cholecystokinin.
- Deposition of solid particles of bile.
- Gallstone formation

=== Complications of Gall Stone
- Within the Gall Bladder
 - Biliary Colid
 - Acute Cholecystitis
 - Chronic Cholecystitis
 - Mucocele of Gall Bladder
 - Empyema Gall Bladder
 - Perforation Gall Bladder
 - Gangrene Gall Bladder
 - Perforation of Gall Bladder
 - Carcinoma Gall Bladder#footnote[worst complication]
- Within bile duct
 - cholangitis
 - Obstructive Jaundice
 - Acute Pancreatitis (Gall Stone Pancreatitis)
- Within intestine
 - GallStone Ileus

=== Gall Stone Ileus
==== Presentation
Acute Intestinal Obstruction
==== Etiology
The fundus of the gall bladder lies in relation with first part of duodenum. A fistula is formed between fundus of gall bladder and first part of duodenum which is called Cholecysto Duodenal Fistula.

A stone travels from the gall bladder through this fistula into the duodenum. The narrowest part of the gut from here is the ileocecal junction, where the stone impacts and causes obstruction.


=== Incisions for Laproscopic Cholecystectomy
- Umbilical (cameral port)
- Epigastric (working port)
- Right hypochondriac (working port)
- Right iliac fossa (fundus retracting port)

The major duodenal papilla : 10 cm from pylorus
The minor duodenal papilla : 8 cm from pylorus


== T-Tube
The purpose of T-tube is to give rest to the common bile duct.

Due to inflammation, the common bile duct is edematous and hence does not allow drainage of bile, if it is left as such, the accumulating bile will cause pressure and prevent healing. To prevent this T-tube is inserted, which helps in drainage of Bile and allows the common bile duct to heal.

=== Removal of T-Tube
Removed on the 10#super[th] day by sustained continued gentle traction along the long axis of the bag.

Precautions to be taken during removal of the T-Tube

- T-tube should be connected within a sterile container to prevent ascending cholangitis
- Daily monitoring of color, amount of effluent
- At the 7#super[th] POD intermittent clamping of T-Tube with increasing in time. During this period assess the patient wheter there is any pain, fever arises or not.
- At the 9#super[th] POD I will do a post-operative T-Tube cholangiogram.
- If free flow of contrast within the intestine or no negative shadow in the bile duct then at 10#super[th] POD remove the T-Tube with sustain gentle traction.
- If there is any negative shadow within the bile duct. It could be stone, blood clot, air bubbles.
- So, I will keep the T-Tube for another 7 days.
- After 7 days I will do another post-operative T-Tube cholangiogram.
- If resolves it could be air bubble or clot. I will remove T-Tube.
- If the negative shodow persisits then it could be stone.
- If stone it will be remove by ERCP then remove the T-Tube with sustain gentle traction.
