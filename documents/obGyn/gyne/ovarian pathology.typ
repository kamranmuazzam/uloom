= Ovarian Pathology

== Ovarian Tumors
=== Classification
#viva
- Epithelial origin.
- Germ cell tumors.

=== Benign vs Malignant
#viva
- Differentiation.
- *Case:* 20yo, mobile lump, severe pain.
  - Benign vs Malignant differentiation.
#high_yeild
- *Malignant features:* Ascites, Fixed, Bilateral, Rapid growth, Solid parts.
- *Markers:* CA-125 (Epithelial), AFP/hCG (Germ cell).

=== Complications of Benign Tumors
#viva
- *Case:* 24yo, severe pain, tachycardia, tender cystic mass.
  - Diagnosis (Torsion/Rupture).
  - Treatment.

=== Malignancy
#viva
- *Case:* Perimenopausal, rapidly growing mass, ascites, fixed hard mass.
  - Diagnosis.
  - Confirmation.
  - Treatment.

=== Specific Tumors
==== Dermoid Cyst
#viva
- *Case:* Mobile lump with tooth-like structure.
  - Diagnosis.
  - Treatment.
- Benign or Malignant? Why?
#high_yeild
- *Type:* Mature Cystic Teratoma.
- *Rokitansky Protuberance:* Solid focus inside cyst.
- *Risk:* Torsion (Heavy).

==== Mucinous Cystadenoma
#viva
- Risks.
- Pseudomyxoma peritonei.
#high_yeild
- *Size:* Can become massive.
- *Pseudomyxoma:* Jelly-like ascites; check Appendix.

== Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
=== Diagnosis
#viva
- Criteria.
#high_yeild
- *Rotterdam Criteria (2/3):* Oligo-ovulation, Hyperandrogenism, PCO on USG (>20 follicles).

=== Treatment
#viva
- Treatment modalities.
#high_yeild
- *Infertility:* Letrozole (Aromatase inhibitor) is drug of choice.
- *Metformin:* For insulin resistance.
