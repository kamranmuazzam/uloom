= Early Pregnancy Complications

== Abortion

=== Habitual Abortion
*Definition* #viva
- ≥3 consecutive spontaneous abortions before 20 weeks.

#high_yeild
- *Causes:*
  - Uterine anomalies (especially septate uterus)
  - Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA)
  - Parental balanced chromosomal translocation
  - Luteal phase defect
  - Poorly controlled diabetes, thyroid disorders
- *Investigations:*
  - Parental karyotyping
  - Antiphospholipid antibody testing
  - Uterine evaluation (HSG/sonohysterography)

---

=== Threatened Abortion
*Definition* #viva
- Bleeding before 20 weeks with closed cervical os and live fetus.

==== Management
#viva
- Bed rest and reassurance
- Avoid intercourse
- Progesterone supplementation if indicated
- Treat infections
- Rh-D Ig 50 mcg IM if Rh negative

#high_yeild
- *Prognosis:* Presence of fetal cardiac activity on USG — best indicator of continuation.
- *Anti-D:* Administer 50 mcg if Rh negative.

---

=== Missed Abortion
*Definition* #viva
- Fetal death before 20 weeks with retention of products in uterus.

==== Complications
#viva
- Infection
- DIC (if retained >4 weeks)
- Subinvolution

#high_yeild
- *USG Criteria:*
  - CRL >7 mm with no cardiac activity
  - MSD >25 mm with no embryo
- *Coagulation:* Prolonged retention → release of thromboplastin → DIC risk.

---

=== Septic Abortion
*Definition* #viva
- Infection involving uterus and/or pelvic tissues following abortion.

==== Complications
#viva
- Endometritis
- Pelvic abscess
- Peritonitis
- Septicemia
- DIC
- Renal failure

==== Management
#viva
- *Case:* 9 weeks pregnancy, induced abortion, fever, foul discharge.
  - *Provisional Diagnosis:* Septic abortion.
  - *Confirmation:* Clinical findings + USG pelvis + culture of discharge/blood.
  - *Principles of management:*
    - Hospitalization and monitoring
    - IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (cephalosporin + metronidazole + gentamicin)
    - Uterine evacuation after stabilization
    - Manage complications (DIC, renal failure)

#high_yeild
- *Organism:* _Clostridium perfringens_ (gas gangrene) — rare, fatal.
- *Grades:*
  - I – Infection limited to uterus
  - II – Involves adnexa/pelvis
  - III – Generalized peritonitis or sepsis

=== Causes of Abortion

==== 1st Trimester Causes
#viva
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Infections (TORCH, malaria)
- Endocrine causes (DM, hypothyroidism, luteal defect)
- Maternal systemic illness
- Drugs, radiation

#high_yeild
- *Genetic:* Chromosomal abnormalities (especially autosomal trisomy) cause ~50% of early losses.

==== 2nd Trimester Causes
#viva
- Cervical incompetence
- Uterine anomalies (bicornuate/septate uterus)
- Maternal infections (syphilis, listeria)
- Placental causes
- Trauma

#high_yeild
- *Anatomical:* Cervical incompetence, bicornuate uterus.

---

== Menstrual Regulation (MR)
*Definition* #viva
- Evacuation of uterine contents within 14 days of missed period, without confirming pregnancy.

=== Complications
#viva
- Incomplete evacuation
- Hemorrhage
- Infection/sepsis
- Uterine perforation

- *Case:* 25yo, 3 days post-MR, pain, bleeding, foul discharge.
  - *Diagnosis:* Incomplete septic abortion.
  - *Investigations:*
    - USG pelvis
    - CBC
    - Serum β-hCG
    - Culture/sensitivity
  - *Management:*
    - IV fluids and antibiotics
    - Uterine evacuation under antibiotic cover
    - Rh prophylaxis if indicated

---

== Ectopic Pregnancy
*Definition* #viva
- Implantation of fertilized ovum outside uterine cavity.

=== Sites
#viva
- Fallopian tube (most common)
  - Ampulla (70%)
  - Isthmus
  - Fimbria
- Interstitial (cornual)
- Ovarian
- Cervical
- Abdominal

#high_yeild
- *Ampulla:* Most common site.
- *Interstitial/Cornual:* Most dangerous — delayed rupture, severe hemorrhage.

=== Risk Factors
#viva
- PID
- Previous ectopic pregnancy
- Tubal surgery or ligation
- IUCD use
- ART/IVF conception
- Endometriosis
- Tubal anomalies

=== Diagnosis
#viva
- *Investigations:*
  - Urine/serum β-hCG
  - Transvaginal USG
  - Diagnostic laparoscopy (if uncertain)
- *Case:* Short amenorrhea, lancinating pain, shock (Pulse 120, BP 80/40)
  - *Provisional Diagnosis:* Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
  - *Investigations:*
    - USG/FAST
    - β-hCG
    - Hb, blood grouping & cross-matching

#high_yeild
- *β-hCG Doubling Time:* Rise < 66% in 48 hr — suggests nonviable/ectopic pregnancy.
- *Classic Triad:* Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding (seen in < 50% cases).

=== Management
#viva
- *Medical:*
  - Methotrexate — single/multidose regimens
- *Surgical:*
  - Salpingostomy
  - Salpingectomy
  - Laparoscopy/laparotomy based on stability

#high_yeild
- *Methotrexate Criteria:*
  - Hemodynamically stable
  - Sac < 3.5 cm
  - No fetal cardiac activity
  - β-hCG < 5000 IU/L

---

== Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD)

=== Hydatidiform Mole
*Definition* #viva
- Cystic swelling of chorionic villi with trophoblastic proliferation.

==== Diagnosis
#viva
- *Clinical Features:*
  - Amenorrhea followed by irregular bleeding
  - Uterus larger than expected
  - Early-onset pre-eclampsia
  - Hyperemesis
- *Investigations:*
  - USG — “snowstorm” / “cluster of grapes”
  - β-hCG markedly elevated
  - Theca lutein cysts (bilateral)

- *Case:* 12 weeks amenorrhea, severe vomiting, uterus > dates, “snow storm” USG.
  - *Provisional Diagnosis:* Complete hydatidiform mole.

#high_yeild
- *Complete Mole:*
  - 46XX, paternal origin (empty ovum fertilized by sperm)
  - No fetus
  - Higher malignancy rate
- *Partial Mole:*
  - 69XXY triploidy
  - Fetus may be present
- *Ovaries:* Bilateral theca lutein cysts due to high hCG.

==== Management
===== Management of the case
#viva
- Evacuation by suction under oxytocin cover.
- Histopathological confirmation.
- Anti-D to Rh-negative women.
- Baseline chest X-ray, LFTs, renal function.

===== Follow-up regime
#viva
- β-hCG weekly until normal ×3 weeks.
- Then monthly ×6 months.
- Chest X-ray if rising levels.

===== Contraception during follow-up
#viva
- Avoid conception for at least 6–12 months.
- Use barrier or combined OCPs.

==== Complications
#viva
- Persistent GTN
- Choriocarcinoma
- Uterine perforation
- Embolization

=== Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN)
*Definition* #viva
- Persistent or malignant trophoblastic proliferation with elevated β-hCG after any pregnancy.

==== Classification
#viva
- Invasive mole
- Choriocarcinoma
- Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT)
- Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT)

==== Chemotherapy
===== Indications following mole evacuation
#viva
- Rising or plateaued β-hCG
- Metastatic disease
- Histologic diagnosis of malignancy
- Very high initial β-hCG (>20,000 IU/L)

#high_yeild
- *Choriocarcinoma:* Early hematogenous spread — primarily to lungs and vagina.
- *Scoring:* WHO prognostic scoring:
  - ≤6 → Low risk → Methotrexate
  - >6 → High risk → EMA-CO regimen
