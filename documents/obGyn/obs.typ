= Multiple Pregnancy

== Definition#viva
Multiple pregnancy refers to the conception and development of two or more fetuses in the same uterus simultaneously.  
Twin pregnancy is the most common type of multiple pregnancy.

== Varieties of Twin Pregnancy#viva
- *Dizygotic (Fraternal) Twins*  
  - Result from fertilization of two separate ova by two sperms.  
  - Always dichorionic, diamniotic.  
  - May be of same or different sex.  
- *Monozygotic (Identical) Twins*  
  - Result from division of a single fertilized ovum.  
  - Classification by timing of division:  
    - *Dichorionic, Diamniotic:* Division within 3 days.  
    - *Monochorionic, Diamniotic:* Division between days 4-8.  
    - *Monochorionic, Monoamniotic:* Division between days 8-13.  
    - *Conjoined twins:* Division after day 13.  


== Antenatal Complications of Twin Pregnancy#viva
- Hyperemesis gravidarum  
- Anemia  
- Pre-eclampsia and hypertension  
- Polyhydramnios or oligoamnios (especially in monochorionic twins)  
- Preterm labor  
- Malpresentations common  
- Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (monochorionic)  
- IUGR  
- Antepartum hemorrhage  

== Fetal Risks of Twin Pregnancy#viva
- Prematurity  
- Intrauterine growth restriction  
- Congenital anomalies (↑ in monozygotic)  
- Twin-twin transfusion syndrome  
- Cord accidents (monoamniotic twins)  
- Increased perinatal mortality and morbidity  
- Vanishing twin or fetus papyraceus  
- Malpresentation or cord prolapse during delivery

== Vanishing and Fetal Papyraceous Phenomena#viva
=== Vanishing Twin Syndrome
  Early death and complete resorption of one twin, usually in first trimester; may be detected by early ultrasound but later only one fetus remains.  
=== Fetus Papyraceus (Paper-like fetus)
  When one twin dies after the fetus is well formed (usually in second trimester), it gets compressed between membranes and uterine wall forming a flattened, mummified fetus. The surviving twin may have growth restriction or, if monochorionic, vascular complications due to shared circulation.

== Procedure of Delivery of Second Baby of Twin Pregnancy#viva
+ Confirm twin pregnancy after first baby's delivery.  
+ Clamp and cut cord near perineum.  
+ Palpate abdomen to determine lie and presentation of second twin.  
+ Rupture membranes under control when head engaged.  
+ Delivery options:  
   - Cephalic → allow spontaneous or assisted vaginal delivery.  
   - Breech → breech extraction.  
   - Transverse/oblique → internal podalic version or cesarean if necessary.  
+ Maintain uterine tone with oxytocin and monitor FHR continuously.  

== Complications That May Arise After Delivery#viva
- Postpartum hemorrhage (uterine overdistension)  
- Retained placenta or membranes  
- Subinvolution of uterus  
- Puerperal sepsis  
- Anemia and thrombophlebitis in mother

= Formation of Lower Uterine Section#viva


= Labor

Definition#viva: Labor is the process by which regular, effective uterine contractions lead to progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix, descent of the presenting part, and expulsion of the fetus, placenta, and membranes after 28 weeks of gestation.

== Normal Labor
=== Criteria of Normal Labor#viva
- Term (37-42 weeks) singleton pregnancy.  
- Vertex presentation with occiput anterior position.  
- Spontaneous onset and progression of uterine contractions.  
- Normal duration (12-14 hrs in primigravida; 6-8 hrs in multipara).  
- No undue maternal or fetal complications.  
- Vaginal delivery with minimal intervention and blood loss (< 500 mL).

=== Pre-requisites for Normal Vaginal Delivery#high-yeild
- Efficient uterine contractions.  
- Sufficiently wide birth canal and pelvis.  
- Normally developed fetus (average size).  
- Favorable attitude, lie, and presentation.  
- Effective maternal expulsive efforts.

=== Labor Pain
==== True Labor Pain
*Characteristics of True Labor Pain*#viva  
- Regular, rhythmic contractions increasing in frequency and intensity.  
- Begin in back and radiate to abdomen and thighs.  
- Associated with cervical effacement and dilatation.  
- Show (mucous blood-stained discharge) present.  
- Not relieved by rest or sedation.  

==== False Labor Pain
Definition#viva: Irregular, short-lived, mild uterine contractions without cervical changes, commonly seen in the last weeks of pregnancy and relieved by rest or sedation.  

*Show:* Blood-stained mucoid discharge due to separation of membranes from lower uterine segment—indicates the onset of true labor is near.

== Stages of Labor
Stages with Duration#viva  
+ *First Stage:* Onset of true labor pain till full dilatation (10 cm).  
   - Primigravida: 8-12 hrs  
   - Multipara: 6-8 hrs

+ *Second Stage:* From full dilatation to delivery of baby.  
   - Primigravida: 30-45 min  
   - Multipara: 15-30 min  
+ *Third Stage:* From delivery of baby to expulsion of placenta and membranes.  
   - Duration: 5-15 min  
+ *Fourth Stage:* One hour immediately after delivery; watch for hemorrhage or shock.  

=== Management of the Third Stage#high-yeild
- *Active management*:  
  - Oxytocin 10 IU IM after delivery of anterior shoulder.

1. *Engagement:* Biparietal diameter passes pelvic inlet.  
2. *Descent:* Downward movement due to uterine contractions.  
3. *Flexion:* Chin on chest to present smaller suboccipitobregmatic diameter.  
4. *Internal rotation:* Occiput rotates anteriorly to symphysis pubis.  
5. *Extension:* Head extends to pass under pubic arch.  
6. *External rotation (restitution):* Realignment of head with shoulders.  
7. *Expulsion:* Delivery of shoulders and body follows.

== Abnormal Labor
=== Incoordinate Uterine Action#high-yeild
Definition: Disorderly uterine contractions in force, frequency, or polarity leading to inefficient labor.

==== Types#high-yeild  
- Hypertonic contractions.  
- Hypotonic contractions.  
- Uterine inertia (most common).  

==== Management#high-yeild  
- Identify cause (obstruction, anxiety, full bladder).

*Clinical Presentation*#viva  
- Failure of descent, Bandl's ring visible.  
- Abdomen tender, uterus hypertonic.  
- Maternal distress, dehydration, and exhaustion.  
- Fetal heart absent or decelerations.  

==== Causes#viva
- Fetal: Malpresentation, hydrocephalus.  
- Pelvic: Contracted pelvis or tumor.  
- Soft tissue: Cervical stenosis, rigid perineum.

==== Complications#viva  
Immediate: Exhaustion, rupture, sepsis.  
Late: Fistula, chronic ill health.

==== Management#viva
- Stabilize mother, IV fluids, antibiotics.
