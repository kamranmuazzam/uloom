= Hypertension in Pregnancy

== Preeclampsia
*Definition* #viva  
A pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder characterized by *new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation with proteinuria and/or evidence of end-organ dysfunction* in a previously normotensive woman.

#high-yield
- *Hypertension:* ≥140/90 mmHg on two occasions, at least 4 hours apart.  
- *Proteinuria:* ≥300 mg/24 h or ≥1+ on dipstick.  
- May present without proteinuria if there is thrombocytopenia, renal, hepatic, CNS, or visual involvement.

=== Presentation
#viva
- Headache, visual disturbances (blurred vision, flashes).  
- Facial and pedal edema (may be pitting).  
- Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain.  
- Oliguria in severe cases.  
- BP ≥140/90 mmHg and proteinuria on urine dipstick.  

Given Example:  
Mrs. M, 26 years old, at 33 weeks, BP 150/100 mmHg, urine (+++) protein → consistent with preeclampsia.

#high-yield
- Common in primigravida and multiple pregnancies.  
- Symptoms often appear in 3rd trimester.  
- Complaint of “seeing stars” → indicates impending convulsion risk.

=== Investigations
#card
- *Urine:* Proteinuria by dipstick or 24-hour collection.  
- *Blood tests:* CBC, platelet count, peripheral smear (HELLP screen), serum creatinine, uric acid, liver enzymes (AST/ALT).  
- *Fetal evaluation:* NST, Doppler velocimetry, ultrasound for growth and amniotic fluid.  
- *Fundus examination:* Hypertensive retinopathy changes.

#high-yield
- Increased uric acid and low platelets are early indicators.  
- Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets = *HELLP syndrome*.  

=== Complications
#viva
*Maternal* #viva  
- Eclampsia (seizures)  
- HELLP syndrome  
- Abruptio placentae  
- DIC  
- Acute renal failure  
- Pulmonary edema  
- Hepatic rupture  
- Cerebral hemorrhage  

*Fetal* #viva  
- IUGR  
- Prematurity  
- Fetal distress  
- Intrauterine death  
- Oligohydramnios  

#high-yield
- *Abruption + Proteinuria + Hypertension* → strongly suggest severe disease.  
- Antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if preterm.

=== Management
#viva
*General:*  
- Admit to hospital, bed rest in left lateral position.  
- Monitor BP, urine protein, urine output, reflexes, FHR.  
- Diet: normal salt, adequate protein.

*Medical:*  
- *Antihypertensives:*  
  - Labetalol (first choice) 100-200 mg PO q8h.  
  - Nifedipine 10-20 mg PO q8h.  
  - Methyldopa 250-500 mg PO q8h (older option).  
- *Magnesium sulfate* to prevent eclampsia (loading and maintenance).  
- *Corticosteroids* if < 34 weeks for lung maturity.

*Delivery:*  
- Definitive cure is *delivery of fetus and placenta*.  
- Induce labor if ≥37 weeks or earlier if maternal/fetal danger (uncontrolled BP, severe symptoms, abnormal Doppler, etc.).  

#high-yield
- Fluid restriction to 80 mL/h or 1 mL/kg/h to prevent pulmonary edema.  
- Avoid ACE inhibitors and diuretics (except in pulmonary edema).  

=== Severe Preeclampsia
==== Criteria
#viva
- BP ≥160/110 mmHg on ≥2 readings 4 hours apart  
- Proteinuria ≥5 g/24 h or ≥3+ on dipstick  
- Oliguria (< 500 mL/24 h)  
- Neurological symptoms (headache, visual disturbance, altered sensorium)  
- Epigastric or RUQ pain  
- Platelet count < 100,000/mm³  
- Elevated liver enzymes or creatinine  
- Fetal growth restriction  

#high-yield
- Managed in tertiary care setup.  
- Magnesium sulfate mandatory for prophylaxis.  
- Delivery planned after stabilization irrespective of gestational age (if maternal/fetal risk present).

== Magnesium Sulfate (MagSulf)
Used for prophylaxis and treatment of eclampsia.

=== Dose
*Loading Dose* #viva  
- *Pritchard regimen:*  
  - 4 g MgSO₄ IV over 5-10 min, followed by 10 g IM (5 g in each buttock).  
  - *Maintenance:* 5 g IM every 4 hours in alternate buttocks.  
  - Continue for 24 hours after last seizure or delivery.  

#high-yield
- Therapeutic serum magnesium = 4-7 mEq/L.  
- Use deep IM injection with lignocaine to reduce pain.  
- Monitor to avoid toxicity.

=== Monitoring of Patient during Therapy
#viva
- *Respiratory rate:* should be >16/min.  
- *Patellar reflexes:* must be present.  
- *Urine output:* >25 mL/hr.  
If any absent → hold dose and give *10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV slowly* (antidote).

#high-yield
- Loss of reflexes → first sign of toxicity.  
- Stop MgSO₄ if serum magnesium >8 mEq/L or respiratory rate < 12/min.

== Impending Eclampsia
=== Features
#viva
- Severe frontal headache  
- Blurred vision or diplopia  
- Epigastric or RUQ pain  
- Restlessness, confusion  
- Hyperreflexia with ankle clonus  
- Rapidly rising BP and marked edema

#high-yield
- Indicates imminent convulsion—requires *immediate magnesium sulfate* and stabilization.  

== Eclampsia
*Definition* #card  
Occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions and/or coma in a woman with preeclampsia, not attributable to other causes.

=== Stages of Eclamptic Fit
#viva
1. *Premonitory stage:* facial twitching, eye rolling, rigidity.  
2. *Tonic stage:* generalized muscle contraction lasting ~30 sec, respiration stops.  
3. *Clonic stage:* jerky movements of limbs for 1-2 min, respiration resumes.  
4. *Comatose stage:* unconsciousness or deep sleep follows.

#high-yield
- Convulsions may recur every few minutes without treatment.  
- Fetal distress common during convulsion; delivery indicated after stabilization.

=== Causes of Maternal Death in Eclampsia
#viva
- Cerebral hemorrhage  
- Pulmonary edema  
- Aspiration pneumonitis  
- Renal failure  
- DIC and shock  

#high-yield
- Aggressive BP control (labetalol/nifedipine), seizure prevention (MgSO₄), and timely delivery significantly reduce mortality.  
- Postpartum eclampsia can occur within 48 hours, so monitoring for ≥24-48 hours post-delivery is essential.
