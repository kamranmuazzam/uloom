= Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)

*Definition* #viva  
Carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity resulting in hyperglycemia with onset or first recognition during pregnancy (usually diagnosed after 24 weeks).

#high-yield
- Applies regardless of whether insulin or diet control is used, or if the condition persists after pregnancy.  
- Caused by insulin resistance due to placental hormones (hPL, estrogen, progesterone, cortisol). 
- Women who had diabetes before pregnancy are termed as *pregestational diabetes*, or "primigravida at 37 weeks with DM" 

== Risk Factors
#viva
- Obesity (BMI >25 kg/m²)  
- Family history of diabetes (first-degree relative)  
- Previous macrosomic baby (>4 kg)  
- Previous unexplained stillbirth or neonatal death  
- Polyhydramnios  
- Recurrent abortion  
- Age >25 years  
- Previous GDM or impaired glucose tolerance  
- Multiple pregnancy  

#high-yield
- South Asian women have higher risk.  
- Glycemic load increases progressively from 24-28 weeks due to placental hormones.  

== Complications
#viva
*Maternal Complications*  
- Preeclampsia  
- Polyhydramnios  
- Increased risk of cesarean delivery  
- Urinary tract infections  
- Preterm labor  
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (rare)  
- Future development of Type 2 DM  

*Fetal Complications*  
- Macrosomia (“large for gestational age”)  
- Birth trauma (shoulder dystocia, nerve injury)  
- Fetal distress, stillbirth  
- Hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia in newborn  
- Respiratory distress syndrome  
- Congenital malformations (especially in pre-existing diabetes)  

#high-yield
- “Pedal edema with fetal overgrowth and excessive liquor” → suspect GDM.  
- Neonatal hypoglycemia results from sudden absence of maternal glucose after birth.  

== Treatment
#viva
1. *Dietary modification:*  
   - 30-35 kcal/kg/day for normal weight; 25 kcal/kg/day for overweight.  
   - Small frequent meals; increased fiber intake.  
   - Avoid concentrated sugars and refined carbohydrates.
2. *Exercise:*  
   - Moderate physical activity if not contraindicated.
3. *Medical:*  
   - If blood sugar > fasting 95 mg/dL or 2-hour >120 mg/dL → start Insulin.  
   - Oral hypoglycemics (Metformin) can be used if patient cannot take insulin and is not in early gestation.
4. *Monitoring:*  
   - 4-point glucose profile daily (fasting & post-meals).  
   - Urinalysis for ketones if glucose poorly controlled.
5. *Delivery:*  
   - Aim for 38-40 weeks with good control.  
   - Cesarean if estimated fetal weight >4 kg.  
   - Insulin discontinued after delivery, re-evaluate 6 weeks postpartum.  

#high-yield
- Avoid oral hypoglycemics in early pregnancy due to teratogenic concern.  
- Insulin requirement falls abruptly after delivery; monitor maternal glucose closely.  

== Condition to Terminate Pregnancy
#viva
- Poor glycemic control despite intensive therapy.  
- Fetal distress or abnormal NST/BPP.  
- IUGR or evidence of placental insufficiency.  
- Associated preeclampsia or other maternal complications.  
- Polyhydramnios with significant symptoms.  
- At 38-40 weeks if fetus mature and stable.  

#high-yield
- If macrosomia suspected >4.5 kg → planned cesarean to prevent shoulder dystocia.  
- Administer corticosteroids if delivery < 37 weeks (for lung maturity).  

== Screening Methods
#viva
- *Universal screening:* all pregnant women at 24-28 weeks.  
- *OGTT*
- *DIPSI (Indian) one-step test:*  
  - Give 75 g oral glucose (non-fasting); measure plasma glucose after 2 hours.  
  - ≥140 mg/dL = GDM.  
- *Two-step approach (ACOG):*  
  - 50 g GCT (non-fasting); if ≥140 mg/dL → 100 g OGTT fasting (≥2 abnormal values positive).  

#high-yield
- WHO criterion: 75 g OGTT; fasting ≥92 mg/dL, 1 hr ≥180 mg/dL, 2 hr ≥153 mg/dL → GDM.  
- Early screening (first ANC visit) for high-risk women.  
- Postpartum follow-up OGTT at 6-12 weeks due to risk of future Type 2 DM.
