- Rh negative, BOH, malpresentations, APH  

#high_yeild
- BMI < 18.5 or >30 kg/m².  
- Teenage pregnancies: risk of anemia, PIH, and LBW.  
- Grand multiparity: placenta previa, PPH.  
- Previous LSCS: risk of scar rupture.  

== Diagnosis of Early Pregnancy
#viva
- *Presumptive signs*: Amenorrhea, nausea, breast changes, frequency of micturition, fatigue.  
- *Probable signs*: Positive urine pregnancy test (hCG), uterine enlargement, Hegar and Goodell sign, Chadwick sign, palpable fetal parts later.  
- *Positive signs*: Fetal heart sounds (by Doppler after 10-12 weeks), ultrasound evidence of gestational sac (5 weeks), fetal pole (6 weeks).  

#high_yeild
- β-hCG detectable in serum 8–9 days after ovulation.  
- Yolk sac is the earliest sonographic sign of intrauterine pregnancy (~5 weeks).  
- Absence of embryo with CRL ≥7 mm on USG → missed abortion.  

== Trimesters
#viva

== Multiple Pregnancy

*Definition* #viva
Multiple pregnancy refers to the conception and development of two or more fetuses in the same uterus simultaneously.  
Twin pregnancy is the most common type of multiple pregnancy.

=== Varieties of Twin Pregnancy
#viva
- *Dizygotic (Fraternal) Twins*  
  - Result from fertilization of two separate ova by two sperms.  
  - Always dichorionic, diamniotic.  
  - May be of same or different sex.  
- *Monozygotic (Identical) Twins*  
  - Result from division of a single fertilized ovum.  
  - Classification by timing of division:  
    - *Dichorionic, Diamniotic:* Division within first 3 days after fertilization.  
    - *Monochorionic, Diamniotic:* Division between days 4-8.  
    - *Monochorionic, Monoamniotic:* Division between days 8-13.  
    - *Conjoined Twins:* Division after day 13 leads to incomplete separation.  

#high_yeild
- Monochorionic, diamniotic twins → highest TTTS risk.  
- Dichorionic: “Lambda/Twin-peak sign” on ultrasound.  
- Monochorionic: “T-sign”.  
- Growth discordance >20% → pathological difference.  

=== Antenatal Complications of Twin Pregnancy
#viva
- Hyperemesis gravidarum  
- Anemia  
- Preeclampsia and hypertension  
- Polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios (especially in monochorionic twins)  
- Preterm labor  
- Malpresentations common  
- Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (monochorionic)  
- IUGR  
- Antepartum hemorrhage  

=== Fetal Risks of Twin Pregnancy
#viva
- Prematurity  
- Intrauterine growth restriction  
- Congenital anomalies (↑ incidence in monozygotic)  
- Twin-twin transfusion syndrome  
- Cord accidents (monoamniotic twins)  
- Increased perinatal mortality and morbidity  
- Vanishing twin or fetus papyraceus  
- Malpresentation or cord prolapse during delivery  

=== Vanishing and Fetus Papyraceous Phenomena
#viva
==== Vanishing Twin Syndrome
Early death and complete resorption of one twin, usually in first trimester; may be detected by early ultrasound but later only one fetus remains.  

==== Fetus Papyraceus
When one twin dies after being well-formed (usually in second trimester), it gets compressed between membranes and uterine wall, forming a flattened, mummified fetus.  
The surviving twin may have growth restriction or, if monochorionic, vascular complications due to shared circulation.  

=== Procedure of Delivery of Second Baby of Twin Pregnancy
#viva
+ Confirm twin pregnancy after first baby's delivery.  
+ Clamp and cut cord near perineum.  
+ Palpate abdomen to determine lie and presentation of second twin.  
+ Rupture membranes under control when head engaged.  
+ Delivery options:  
   - Cephalic → spontaneous or assisted vaginal delivery.  
   - Breech → breech extraction.  
   - Transverse/oblique → internal podalic version or cesarean if necessary.  
+ Maintain uterine tone with oxytocin, monitor FHR.  

=== Complications That May Arise After Delivery
#viva
- Postpartum hemorrhage  
- Retained placenta or membranes  
- Subinvolution of uterus  
- Puerperal sepsis  
- Anemia and thrombophlebitis  

== Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR)
#viva
Fetal weight below 10th percentile or < 2.5 kg at term due to failure to achieve expected growth potential.

#high_yeild
- Monitor via symphysiofundal height (difference >3 cm abnormal).  
- Umbilical artery Doppler: absent/reversed diastolic flow → placental insufficiency.  
- MCA/UA ratio < 1 → fetal hypoxia.  
- BPP and NST guide timing of delivery.  

=== Differences between Symmetrical & Asymmetrical IUGR
#viva

- Hemoglobinopathies  
- Chronic infection, malaria, hookworm  

#high_yeild
- WHO: Hb < 11 g/dL == anemia; < 7 g/dL == severe.  
- Severe anemia → transfuse.  
- Use iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose for parenteral correction.  
- Prevent with IFA + calcium tablets.

=== Complications
#viva
