== Asphyxia Neonatorum
#card
Failure of the newborn to establish spontaneous and sustained breathing at birth, usually due to impaired placental or pulmonary oxygen exchange.

#high-yield

= Puerperium
*Definition* #card  
The period starting from the completion of third stage of labor until the organs and systems return to pre-pregnant state (usually 6 weeks).

== Causes of Abnormal Puerperium
#viva
- Infection (puerperal sepsis)  
- Subinvolution of uterus  
- Thromboembolism  
- Mastitis or breast abscess  
- Retained products  
- Postpartum depression

=== Causes
#viva
- Puerperal sepsis  
- Urinary tract infection

- Respiratory infection (pneumonia, atelectasis)  

== Breast Complications in Puerperium
#viva
- Engorgement  
- Cracked nipple  
- Mastitis  
- Breast abscess  

=== Breast Engorgement
#viva
- Occurs due to accumulation of milk and vascular congestion (usually 3-5 days postpartum).  
- Breasts tense, painful, shiny, warm; baby may have difficulty latching.  
- Management: Frequent feeding, warm compress, breast support, mild analgesics.

#high-yield
- Avoid expression unless necessary; can precipitate more milk formation.  
- Cold compress between feeds can reduce discomfort.

== Puerperal Sepsis
*Definition* #card  
Genital tract infection occurring between rupture of membranes and 42 days after delivery.

=== Presentation
#viva
- Fever, chills, abdominal pain  
- Foul-smelling lochia  
- Tender, subinvoluted uterus  
- Tachycardia, malaise  

=== Investigation
#viva
- CBC (leukocytosis)  
- High vaginal and blood cultures  
- Urine analysis  
- USG (retained products)  

=== Management
#viva
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (Ampicillin + Gentamicin + Metronidazole)  
- Maintain hydration, analgesia  
- Remove retained products if present  
- Monitor vitals  
- Surgical drainage if abscess develops  

#high-yield
- Preventable by aseptic delivery, clean postpartum care, early ambulation.  

== Involution
Return of uterus and other genital organs to pre-pregnant state.

=== Subinvolution
*Definition* #card  
Delayed or incomplete return of the uterus to its normal size and condition after delivery.

==== Causes
#card
- Retained placental bits or membranes  
- Infection  
- Fibroids  
- Overdistension (multiple pregnancy)  

#high-yield
- Uterus larger and softer than expected, prolonged lochial discharge.  
- Treatment: remove cause, uterotonics, antibiotics.  

= Lochia
*Definition* #viva  
Vaginal discharge following delivery consisting of blood, mucus, and decidual tissue.

== Types
With duration #viva
- *Lochia rubra:* first 4 days, red, mainly blood.  
- *Lochia serosa:* 5-10 days, brown or yellowish.  
- *Lochia alba:* 10-28 days, whitish mucoid.  

== Clinical Importance
#viva
- Persistence or foul smell → infection or subinvolution.  
- Sudden cessation → possible uterine obstruction or sepsis.

= Still Birth
*Definition* #viva  
Birth of a dead fetus after 28 weeks of gestation.

== Causes
#viva
- Hypertensive disorders, diabetes  
- Antepartum hemorrhage (placenta previa/abruption)  
- Infections (syphilis, TORCH)  
- Fetal malformations  
- Cord accidents  
- Rh isoimmunization  

= Rh Isoimmunization
*Definition* #viva  
Fetal and maternal Rh factor incompatibility leading to maternal antibody formation against fetal red cells.

== Prevention
#viva
- Avoid fetal-maternal blood mixing (careful obstetric technique).  
- Administer Anti-D immunoglobulin 300 µg IM within 72 hours after delivery of Rh-positive baby to Rh-negative mother.  
- Also after abortion, ectopic, invasive procedures.  

== Complications
*Neonatal Complications* #viva
- Hemolytic disease of newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis).  
- Kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy).  
- Hydrops fetalis (severe anemia).  

== Special Investigations for Baby Following Birth
#viva
- Direct Coombs test  
- Serum bilirubin, hematocrit  
- Blood grouping and Rh typing  
- Reticulocyte count  

== Escape from Isoimmunization
Reason why some women escape Isoimmunization #card  
Because fetal red cells may not enter maternal circulation, or due to low maternal immune response / ABO incompatibility that causes destruction of fetal RBCs before sensitization.

#high-yield
- ABO incompatibility offers partial protection against Rh sensitization.

= Neonatal Jaundice
== Causes
#viva
- Physiologic (commonest)  
- Hemolytic (Rh or ABO incompatibility)  
- Sepsis  
- Prematurity  
- G6PD deficiency  
- Biliary atresia  

== Methods of Treatment of Neonatal Jaundice
#viva
- Phototherapy (mainstay for unconjugated)  
- Exchange transfusion if severe (bilirubin >20 mg/dL or rapidly rising).  
- Treat underlying cause (infection, hemolysis).  

== Kernicterus
*Definition* #viva  
Deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in brain tissue (basal ganglia), leading to encephalopathy.

=== Prevention
#viva
- Early detection and treatment of neonatal jaundice.  
- Prompt phototherapy/exchange transfusion.  
- Prevention of Rh incompatibility.  

#high-yield
- Symptoms: lethargy, hypotonia, seizures, opisthotonus.  
- Irreversible neurological damage if untreated.
