= Post Partum Haemorrhage (PPH)

About 500 mL of blood loss is expected in Normal Vaginal Delivery.  
PPH is defined as blood loss exceeding *500 mL after vaginal delivery* or *>1000 mL after cesarean section*, or any blood loss sufficient to cause hemodynamic instability.

*Definition* #viva  
Excessive bleeding from the genital tract after the birth of the baby, which adversely affects the mother's general condition.

#high-yield
- *Most common cause:* Atonic uterus  
- *Leading cause of maternal mortality* worldwide.  
- Quantitative assessment rather than visual estimation recommended.  
- Any woman who becomes *pale, restless, tachycardic, hypotensive* after delivery should be presumed to have PPH.

== Types
#viva
- *Primary PPH:* Occurring within 24 hours of delivery.  
- *Secondary (Late) PPH:* Occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks after delivery.

#high-yield
- Primary PPH is more common and associated with four main causes (“4 Ts”):  
  - *Tone* (uterine atony)  
  - *Tissue* (retained products of conception)  
  - *Trauma* (genital tract injury)  
  - *Thrombin* (coagulopathy)

== Primary Post Partum Haemorrhage
=== Causes
#viva
1. *Uterine atony* (most common)  
2. *Genital tract trauma:* tears of cervix, vagina, perineum.  
3. *Retained tissues:* placenta, membranes, cotyledons.  
4. *Coagulopathies:* DIC, HELLP, severe preeclampsia.  

*Primary PPH Causes due to Atonic Uterus* #viva  
- Overdistension (multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios, macrosomia)  
- Prolonged labor or precipitate labor  
- Induction/augmentation with oxytocin  
- Grand multiparity  
- Chorioamnionitis  
- General anesthesia (especially halogenated agents)

#high-yield
- Atony accounts for about *70-80% of primary PPH*.  
- Should always be suspected when uterus feels *boggy and enlarged* postpartum.  

== Management
In case of retained placenta #viva  
- If the placenta not delivered within 30 minutes → *manual removal of placenta under anesthesia*.  
- Maintain asepsis, empty bladder.  
- Guard uterus per abdomen, use hand in uterus and remove placenta and membranes completely.  

#high-yield
- Inspect placenta after expulsion to ensure completeness.  
- If bleeding continues, evaluate for uterine tone and trauma.  
- Oxytocics must be running concurrently.  

== Causes of Atonic Hemorrhage
#viva
- Overdistension of uterus (polyhydramnios, twins, large baby)  
- Uterine exhaustion (prolonged labor)  
- High parity  
- Retained placenta or membranes  
- Mismanagement of third stage of labor  
- Chorioamnionitis  

#high-yield
- Atony = failure of the uterus to contract effectively after delivery.  
- Lack of uterine contraction → large open sinuses at placental site → hemorrhage.  

== Management of Atonic Hemorrhage
#viva
1. *Call for help, resuscitate:*  
   - Maintain airway, give oxygen.  
   - Start two large bore IV lines with fluids and blood typing/crossmatch.  
2. *Uterine massage*—bimanual compression.  
3. *Uterotonics:*  
   - Oxytocin 10 units IM, then infusion (40 U in 1 L NS \@ 125 mL/hr).  
   - If bleeding persists → Methylergometrine 0.2 mg IM/IV (contraindicated in hypertension).  
   - If still bleeding → Prostaglandins:  
       - Carboprost (15-methyl PGF₂α) 250 µg IM q15-20min (max 8 doses).  
       - Misoprostol 800-1000 µg per rectum.  
4. *Check uterine cavity:* remove retained tissue manually.  
5. *If unresponsive:*  
   - Bimanual compression continued.  
   - Mechanical/ surgical measures:
     - Balloon tamponade (Bakri/Cg condom catheter).  
     - Compression sutures (B-Lynch).  
     - Ligation—uterine, internal iliac arteries.  
     - As last resort: peripartum hysterectomy.  

#high-yield
- *Sequential approach saves lives*—medical → mechanical → surgical.  
- *Bakri balloon* effective temporizing measure.  
- *Tranexamic acid (1 g IV within 3 hr of delivery)* reduces maternal death from bleeding.  

== Prevention
#viva
- Active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL):  
  1. Oxytocin 10 IU IM after delivery of anterior shoulder or baby.  
  2. Controlled cord traction with counter traction on uterus.  
  3. Uterine massage after placental delivery.  

#high-yield
- Proper antenatal correction of anemia.  
- Identify high-risk cases (grand multipara, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios).  
- Avoid prolonged/precipitate labor.  
- Ensure empty bladder and proper supervision of third stage.  
- Keep oxytocics ready before delivery of baby.
