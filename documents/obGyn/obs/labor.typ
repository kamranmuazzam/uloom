= Labor

*Definition*#viva: Series of events that takes place in the female genital tract to expel out the products of conception from the womb to the outer world
== Normal Labor
=== Criteria of Normal Labor
#viva
- Term (37-42 weeks) singleton pregnancy.  
- Vertex presentation with occiput anterior position.  
- Spontaneous onset and progression of uterine contractions.  
- Normal duration (12-14 hrs in primigravida; 6-8 hrs in multipara).  
- No undue maternal or fetal complications.  
- Vaginal delivery with minimal intervention and blood loss (< 500 mL).

=== Pre-requisites for Normal Vaginal Delivery
#high_yeild
- Efficient uterine contractions.  
- Sufficiently wide birth canal and pelvis.  
- Normally developed fetus (average size).  
- Favorable attitude, lie, and presentation.  
- Effective maternal expulsive efforts.

=== Labor Pain
==== True Labor Pain
*Characteristics of True Labor Pain*#viva  
- Regular, rhythmic contractions increasing in frequency and intensity.  
- Begin in back and radiate to abdomen and thighs.  
- Associated with cervical effacement and dilatation.  
- Show (mucous blood-stained discharge) present.  
- Not relieved by rest or sedation.  

*Show:* Blood-stained mucoid discharge due to separation of membranes from lower uterine segment—indicates the onset of true labor is near.
==== False Labor Pain
*Definition*#viva: Irregular, short-lived, mild uterine contractions without cervical changes, commonly seen in the last weeks of pregnancy and relieved by rest or sedation.  

== Stages of Labor
Stages with Duration#viva  
+ *First Stage:* Onset of true labor pain till full dilatation (10 cm).  
   - Primigravida: 8-12 hrs  
   - Multipara: 6-8 hrs  
   - *Latent phase* (0-3 cm) and *Active phase* (3-10 cm).  
+ *Second Stage:* From full dilatation to delivery of baby.  
   - Primigravida: 30-45 min  
   - Multipara: 15-30 min  
+ *Third Stage:* From delivery of baby to expulsion of placenta and membranes.  
   - Duration: 5-15 min  
+ *Fourth Stage:* One hour immediately after delivery; watch for hemorrhage or shock.  

=== Management of the Third Stage
#card
- *Active management* (AMTLS):  
  - Oxytocin 10 IU IM after delivery of anterior shoulder.  
  - Controlled cord traction with counter traction on uterus.  
  - Uterine massage after delivery of placenta.  
- Reduces postpartum hemorrhage.

=== Complications of Third Stage of Labor
#viva
- Postpartum hemorrhage.  
- Retained placenta or membranes.  
- Inversion of uterus.

NVD 8 days back at home.

*Risks involved in prolonged retention of placenta*#viva  
- Primary postpartum hemorrhage.  
- Shock and sepsis.  
- Coagulopathy or subinvolution later.  
- Risk of uterine inversion during attempted manual removal.

=== Episiotomy
*Indications*
#viva

== Mechanism of Labor
*Definition*#viva: Series of mechanical steps by which fetus negotiates its passage through the birth canal.

1. *Engagement:* Biparietal diameter passes pelvic inlet.  
2. *Descent:* Downward movement due to uterine contractions.  
3. *Flexion:* Chin on chest to present smaller suboccipitobregmatic diameter.  
4. *Internal rotation:* Occiput rotates anteriorly to symphysis pubis.  
5. *Extension:* Head extends to pass under pubic arch.  
6. *External rotation (restitution):* Realignment of head with shoulders.  
7. *Expulsion:* Delivery of shoulders and body follows.

=== Abnormalities of Mechanism of Labor#high_yeild
- Deflexed head (occipitoposterior).  
- Face and brow presentation.  
- Asynclitism.  
- Failure of internal rotation.  
- Arrest of descent.

== Fetal Monitoring in Labor
#high_yeild
- Intermittent auscultation every 30 min (first stage), every 5 min (second stage).  
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring in high-risk pregnancy.  
- Fetal scalp pH measurement if distress suspected.

== Presentation

=== Presenting Part
*Definition*#viva: Lowest part of fetus felt on vaginal examination.  
- Vertex (cephalic).  
- Face, brow (cephalic variants).  
- Breech.  
- Shoulder.

=== Malpresentation
*Definition*#viva: Any presentation other than vertex (occiput presenting).  
Commonest malpresentation is breech presentation.

==== Breech Presentation
===== Clinical Presentation
#viva
- Fundal height disproportionately high.  
- Head ballottable in fundus.  
- Breech irregular in lower pole.  
- FHS above umbilicus.  
- PV exam shows sacrum or buttocks.

===== Delivery of the Aftercoming Head of the Breech
#viva
+ *Burns-Marshall method:* Let body hang till nape visible, lift trunk over mother's abdomen to deliver head.  
+ *Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit method:* Support on left forearm, maintain flexion with fingers on malar eminences and pressure on occiput.  
+ *Piper's forceps:* For controlled flexion and delivery.

===== Complications of Vaginal Breech Delivery
#viva
- Birth asphyxia due to delay of head.  
- Intracranial hemorrhage.  
- Cord prolapse.  
- Entrapment of head.  
- Spinal injury.  
- Genital tract tears and PPH.

== Lie
*Definition*#viva: Relation between long axis of fetus and uterus: longitudinal, transverse, or oblique.

#viva
- Multiparity, uterine laxity.  
- Prematurity.  
- Placenta previa.  
- Uterine anomaly or tumor.  
- Polyhydramnios.  
- Second twin.

==== Findings on Abdominal Palpation
#viva

- Head in one flank, breech in other.  
- FHS at umbilicus.  
- Shoulder palpable on PV.

==== Diagnosis
#viva
==== Management
#viva
- Before labor: External cephalic version (after 36 weeks).  
- During early labor: Version if membranes intact.  
- Neglected/advanced labor: Cesarean section.  

==== Dangers of Transverse Lie
#viva
- Obstructed labor
- Uterine rupture
- Cord prolapse
- Fetal death
- Sepsis

== Abnormal Labor
=== Incoordinate Uterine Action
#high_yeild
Definition: Disorderly uterine contractions in force, frequency, or polarity leading to inefficient labor.

==== Types
#high_yeild  
- Hypertonic contractions.  
- Hypotonic contractions.  
- Uterine inertia (most common).  

==== Management
#high_yeild  
- Identify cause (obstruction, anxiety, full bladder).  
- Provide sedation or analgesia.  
- Amniotomy and oxytocin if hypotonic.

=== Obstructed Labor
*Definition*#viva: Stagnation of progress of labor despite good uterine contractions due to mechanical obstruction.  

*Clinical Presentation*#viva  
A primigravida presents at term pregnancy with H/O labour pain for 24
hours at home. O/E patient is exhausted dehydrated, FHR is 100/min.
P/V/E reveals that cervix is fully dilated & vagina is hot & dry.
- Failure of descent, Bandl's ring visible.  
- Abdomen tender, uterus hypertonic.  
- Maternal distress, dehydration, and exhaustion.  
- Fetal heart absent or decelerations.  

==== Causes
#viva
Problem in *3P*
- Problem in *Passage* (Pelvic, Cervical, Perineal): Contracted pelvis or Tumor, Cervical Stenosis, Rigid Perineum
- Problem in *Passanger* (Fetal): Malpresentation, Hydrocephalus.  
- Problem in *Power* (Maternal): Exhaustion

==== Complications
#viva  
*Immediate*
- Exhaustion
- Rupture
- Sepsis
*Late*
- Vesico Vaginal Fistula(VVF)
- chronic Ill Health

==== Management
#viva
- Stabilize mother, IV fluids, antibiotics.  
- *Live fetus, intact uterus:* Cesarean section.  
- *Ruptured uterus:* Laparotomy ± hysterectomy.  
- *Dead fetus:* Craniotomy (if safe).



=== Prolonged Labor
*Definition*#viva: Duration of labor >18 hours in primigravida or >12 hours in multipara.  

*Causes In The First Stage*#viva  
- Incoordinate contractions.  
- Cephalopelvic disproportion.  
- Cervical dystocia.

==== Ventouse Delivery
#viva
Vaccum Extraction
*Advantages over Forceps*#viva  
- Less maternal trauma.  
- Can be done without full anesthesia.  
- Exact head position need not be fully known.
- Less space required in birth canal (useful in mild CPD).


*Disadvantages*#viva

- Scalp injury, cephalhematoma.  
- Cannot be used in premature fetuses (< 34 weeks) due to fragile scalp.
