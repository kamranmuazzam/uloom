= Antepartum Haemorrhage (APH)
*Definition*  
Bleeding from or into the genital tract after 24 weeks of pregnancy and before the birth of the baby.

== Causes
#viva
- *Placenta previa* (implantation of placenta in lower uterine segment)  
- *Abruptio placentae* (premature separation of normally situated placenta)  
- Local causes: *cervical polyp, carcinoma cervix, cervicitis, vaginal varicosities*  
- Rare: *vasa previa*, trauma, coagulation disorders  

#high-yield
- *Most common causes:* Placenta previa and abruption (~90% of APH).  
- Always rule out carcinoma cervix - do *speculum* before digital examination.  
- *Vasa previa* → fetal origin bleeding (fresh red, FHR abnormal quickly).  

== Placenta Previa
*Definition*  
#card
Implantation of placenta in lower uterine segment partially or completely covering the internal os after 24 weeks gestation.

=== Presentation
#card
- *Painless, recurrent, bright red vaginal bleeding* (classically in late 3rd trimester).  
- Uterus soft, non-tender, relaxed.  
- Malpresentation (often transverse or breech) common.  
- Fetal heart sounds usually present (if bleeding not severe).  

#high-yield
- Bleeding often occurs *without provocation*.  
- Common in *multiparas, scarred uterus (post-LSCS, D&C)*.  
- Placenta previa should be suspected if *bleeding at 30-36 weeks* and *malpresentation on palpation*.  
- *Vaginal examination is contraindicated* unless in OT with preparations for delivery.  

=== Types
#card
- *Type I (Low-lying):* Placenta in lower segment but does not reach internal os.  
- *Type II (Marginal):* Edge of placenta reaches internal os but does not cover it.  
- *Type III (Partial/Incomplete central):* Placenta partially covers internal os.  
- *Type IV (Complete/Central):* Placenta completely covers internal os.  

#high-yield
- *Major placenta previa* → Types III and IV (usually require cesarean).  
- *Minor placenta previa* → Types I and II.  
- Diagnosis made by *transvaginal sonography (TVS)* - gold standard.  

=== Treatment of Central Placenta Previa at 37 weeks
#viva
- Admit and ensure blood availability.  
- Deliver by elective *cesarean section*.  
- Avoid vaginal delivery.  
- Active management of third stage (oxytocin infusion).  

#high-yield
- Cord clamping should be delayed only if baby stable.  
- Be prepared for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).  
- Uterotonics and uterine tamponade if bleeding continues.  

=== Management of Placenta Previa bleeding at 34 weeks
#viva
- *Initial:* Hospitalization, bed rest, monitor vitals and FHR.  
- *Stabilize:* IV fluids, cross-match, blood kept ready.  
- *Investigate:* Hb, Hct, coagulation profile, USG for placental location.  
- *Expectant management (Conservative):*
  - Indicated when bleeding subsides, GA < 37 weeks.
  - Observation with corticosteroids for lung maturation.  
  - If recurrent or heavy bleeding → cesarean delivery.  

#high-yield
- *Steroid cover* (betamethasone/dexamethasone) to accelerate lung maturity.  
- *Anti-D* to Rh-negative mothers.  
- Avoid vaginal examination or intercourse.  

=== Differentials
#viva
- *Abruptio placentae* → painful, tender uterus, dark blood.  
- *Local cervical/vaginal lesion* (polyp, carcinoma, varicose vein).  
- *Vasa previa* → fetal bleeding with FHR changes.  

#high-yield
- Use *speculum examination* to rule out local lesions *only after placenta previa excluded on ultrasound*.  

== Abruptio Placenta
Also known as *Accidental Haemorrhage in Pregnancy* — premature separation of a normally situated placenta after 20 weeks and before birth.

=== Presentation
#viva
- *Painful vaginal bleeding* (may be concealed or revealed).  
- *Uterine tenderness and hypertonicity* (“board-like uterus”).  
- *Fetal distress or absent FHR* if severe separation.  
- May have *shock out of proportion* to visible bleeding.  

*Signs:*  
- Uterus tense, tender, and does not relax between contractions.  
- Fundal height greater than dates (concealed blood).  
- Abnormal fetal heart or absent.  

*Symptoms:*  
- Pain in abdomen, often continuous.  
- Vaginal bleeding (dark red).  
- Diminished or absent fetal movements.  

#high-yield
- *Couvelaire uterus* - extravasation of blood into uterine muscle; uterus becomes blue and atonic.  
- *Concealed variety* carries high maternal and fetal mortality.  
- Causes include *hypertension, preeclampsia, trauma, smoking, cocaine use*.  

=== Complications
#viva
*Maternal*  
- Hypovolemic shock  
- DIC  
- Renal failure (due to ischemia and hemoglobinuria)  
- PPH (atonic, traumatic, coagulation defect related)  

*Fetal*  
- Intrauterine hypoxia or death  
- Prematurity  
- Low birth weight  

#high-yield
- *Coagulopathy (DIC)* common due to consumption of clotting factors.  
- *Retained couvelaire uterus* may require hysterectomy if atonic.  
- *Maternal death* mostly due to hemorrhage and renal failure.

)

#high-yield
- PV examination *strictly avoided* in placenta previa unless in OT.  
- In abruption, vaginal exam is permitted for cervical assessment.  
- Placenta previa → recurrent minor bleeds; abruptio → single major painful bleed.
