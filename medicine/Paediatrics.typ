== Diarrhoea
#objective[define diarrhoea, it's aetio-pathogenesis, classification, clinical presentation, complications of diarrhoea]

#question[Define diarrhoea according to WHO and write its 3 important consequences]

*Definition* : According to WHO, diarrhoea is defined as frequent #footnote[3 or more in 24 hour period] passage of loose stools#footnote[Loose stool means that the stool can obtain the shape of the container it is put in.].

3 consequences:
- Increases loss of water and electrolyte
- Loss of greater quantity of zinc.
- Weight Loss.

#objective[define persistent diarrhoea and dysentery]

- Persistent diarrhoea is when diarrhoea lasts for more than 14 days.

_With persistent diarrhoea, the main issue isn't dehydration, the main issue is nutrition. Also there is damage to gut and possible lactose intolerance developed already. So non-lactose nutrition supplementation is requried and also treat malnutrition if exists. Zinc is a must here._

- Dysentery is bloody diarrhoea.
(_Dysentery is colonic infection causing diarrhoea along with passage of blood and mucous with stool._)

#question[Classify Diarrhoea]

- Acute watery diarrhoea(passage of loose stool < 14 days, ≥ 3 times per day, no blood )
- Persistent diarrhoea (passage of loose stool for > 14 days)
- Dysentery (passage of loose stool + blood)

#question[Name the organisms responsible for acute watery diarrhoea]

- Rota virus
- _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, O139
- ETEC (entero-toxigenic E.coli)
- EPEC (entero-pathogenic)
- EAEC (entero-adhesive)
- _Campylobacter jejuni_
- Cryptosporidium

#question[Organims of dysentery]

Dysentery is a symptom, the disease is Gasteroenteritis, mostly Bacterial Gasteroenteritis in paediatric group.

- Shigella (_Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii_)
- _Salmonella enterica_
- EIEC (Entero Invasive)
- EHEC (Entero Hemorrhagic)
- Campylobacter jejuni

_In paediatrics, dysentery is most commonly bacterial, mostly by Shigella. Amoebic dysentery (Entamoeba histolytica) is relatively uncommon in young children. It is seen more in older children and adults._


#question[Complications of Diarrhoea]

- Electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis
- Paralytic ileus
- Acute renal failure
- HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome)
- Growth failure
- Malnutrition
- In case of C. jejuni, GBS
- If there is dysentery
  - Rectal prolapse
  - Convulsion


*Complications of Dysentery* @tasker_oxford_2013[p. ~339]
- Bacteraemia.
- Salmonella, Campylobacter), e.g. Secondary infections (particularly pneumonia, osteomyelitis, meningitis.
- Reiter’s syndrome (Shigella, Campylobacter)
- Haemolytic–uraemic syndrome (E. coli 0157, Shigella). 
- Guillain–Barré syndrome (Campylobacter).
-  Reactive arthropathy (Yersinia).
- Haemorrhagic colitis.

Next Steps : Common for Both

+ Contiue Feeding
  - < 6 months: exclusive breast feeding
  - > 6 months: breast feeding + freshly prepared energy dense complementary food
+ Zinc Supplementation
  - < 6 months : 10 mg/day (10-14 days)
  - ≥6 months: 20 mg/day (10-14 days)
+ Antibiotics
  - Rota viral diarrhoea: no antibiotic
  - Cholera : ciprofloxacin/cotrimoxazol
  - Dysentery: ciprofloxacin#footnote[
Antibiotics are not indicated, as the duration of symptoms is not altered and may increase chronic carrier status, unless there is high risk of disseminated disease, presence of artificial implants (e.g. V-P shunt), severe colitis, severe systemic illness, age < 6mths, enteric fever, cholera or E. coli 0157. Most organisms are sensitive to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, or third generation cephalosporins.
- erythromycin if _Campylobacter_;
- oral vancomycin or metronidazole if _Clostridium difficile_ (causes pseudomembranous colitis).

#objective[describe helminthiasis and their management]
== Helminthiasis
=== Nematodes
==== *_Ascaris lumbricoides_*

Can cause Loeffler's Syndrome(an eosinophilic pneumonia, that can mimic asthma, also caused by the parasites _Strongyloides stercoralis_, and the hookworms _Ancylostoma duodenale_ and _Necator americanus_.)

*Treatment*
- Mebendazole 100 mg PO(chewable) q12h x 3 days
- or, Albendazole 400 mg PO(chewable or 10 ml suspension) x 1 dose
  - or, Albendazole 200 mg PO(chewable or 5 ml suspension) x 1 dose.
- or, Pyrantel pamoate 10 mg/kg PO single dose

==== _Trichuris trichiura_ (whip worm)
Lives in the colon and causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.

*Treatment* : Mebendazole or Albendazole

==== Hookworms (_Necator americanus_, _Ancylostoma duodenale_)
- Infection is by larvae penetrating the skin, e.g. bare feet. The adult worms live in the intestine voraciously sucking blood leading to anaemia and hypoproteinaemia.
*Treatment* : Mebendazole.

==== _Strongyloides stercoralis_
- Penetrates the skin and migrates to the lungs. Then coughed up and ingested into the gut.
- Causes bloating, heartburn, and malabsorption.

*Treatment* : Mebendazole, Albendazole, or thirabendazole

==== _Enterobius vermicularis_ (thread or pinworm)
- Very common and causes anal pruritis as females emerge and lay eggs in peri-anal region.
- Infection: occrus by faecal-oral transmission of eggs.
- Diagnosis: is confirmed by direct visualization of worms on peri-anal area or in stool, or microscopy of sellotape previously applied to the anus

*Treatment* : Mebendazole

=== Cestodes(Tapeworms)
- Infection : Results from ingesting undercooked contaminated pork(Taenia solium), beef(Taenia saginata), or fish(Diphyllobothrium latum#footnote[also causes B12 deficiency])
- Diagnosis is by microscopy of eggs or proglottides in stool

*Treatment* : Praziquantel
=== Mebendazole Dosage
_Ascariasis, Anchylostomiasis, Trichuriasis_

Child: > 1 year

100 mg bid for 3 consecutive days or 500 mg as single dose or 1 teaspoonful(5 ml) bid for 3 consecutive days.

If cure is not achieved 3 weeks after treatment, a second course of treatment is advised.

_Taeniasis & Strongyloides_

100 mg bid for 3 consecutive days.

If cure is not achieved 3 weeks after treatment, a second course of treatment is advised.
